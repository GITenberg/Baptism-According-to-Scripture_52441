<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a Clerical Meeting in the
country this Question was lately proposed for
discussion;&mdash;&ldquo;What may be deduced <i>from Holy
Scripture</i> concerning Baptism, as a Sacrament of the Christian
Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, it appeared
to one of the members present to be necessary, that <i>every
passage of Scripture bearing upon the subject</i> should be
considered, and its true meaning sought; and that care should of
course be taken, that no text be so expounded as to make it
repugnant to another.&nbsp; This course was consequently pursued
by him.&nbsp; Each passage was examined in succession; and though
the inquiry extended much beyond his expectation, and was not
carried through without pains, yet the interest of the research
more than compensated for the labour of it.</p>
<p>The subject being of great importance, and more especially at
the present time, it was thought that the cause of truth would be
served by the publication <a name="pageiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>of what had been written; and a
request was made to that effect.&nbsp; In the hope, and with the
earnest desire and prayer, that such may be the result, the
writer has consented to its publication: and as the Church, to
which it is his privilege to belong, has declared concerning Holy
Scripture, &ldquo;that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be
proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should
be believed as an Article of the faith,&rdquo; (Art.
vi.)&mdash;he feels himself fully justified, as a Minister of the
Church, in having endeavoured simply to ascertain the sense of
Scripture, in the several texts which have come before him.</p>
<p><i>January</i>, 1850.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>ON
BAPTISM,<br />
<span class="GutSmall"><i>&amp;c.&nbsp; &amp;c.</i></span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is thought by some, that
baptism, or the washing of the person or clothes, as a religious
ceremony, commenced immediately after the deluge.&nbsp; St. Peter
certainly speaks of baptism in connection with that great event:
(1 Ep. iii. 20, 21,)&mdash;&ldquo;While the ark was a preparing,
wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water: the like
figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, however this might be, we read of it at an
early period.&nbsp; The first instance on record in Scripture of
this washing as a preparation for God&rsquo;s service, is
probably that which is found in Genesis xxxv. 2.&nbsp; God had
said unto Jacob, &ldquo;Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there,
and make thee an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou
fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.&nbsp; Then Jacob said
unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>away the
strange gods that are among you, <i>and be clean</i>, <i>and
change your garments</i>; and let us arise, and go up to Bethel,
and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the
day of my distress.&rdquo;&nbsp; The direction&mdash;&ldquo;Be
clean,&rdquo; taken in connection with the change of their
garments, did probably, among other things, mean the washing of
themselves with water, as an emblem of the putting away of
sin.&nbsp; Dr. Lightfoot understands by it Jacob&rsquo;s
admission of the proselytes of Shechem and Syria into his
religion by baptism; because circumcision was become odious to
them.&nbsp; The cloud which God spread over the Israelites for a
covering, (Ps. cv. 39,) when they came out of Egypt, and their
safe passage through the waters of the Red Sea, appear to have
had reference to the same subject; for the Apostle Paul, in 1
Cor. x. 1, 2, thus writes;&mdash;&ldquo;Moreover, brethren, I
would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers
were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were
all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now if they were &ldquo;baptized unto Moses,&rdquo; (which
baptism represented and confirmed their obligation to follow
Moses as their leader, and to obey the instructions and laws
which he should give them,) much more were they baptized and
bound unto God: or rather, they were baptized and bound unto
Moses, as the minister of God and the medium of communication
between God and the people.</p>
<p>When the Israelites had entered the wilderness <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>and had come to
Mount Sinai, where God intended to give them His covenant, He
&ldquo;said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes, and be
ready against the third day; for the third day the Lord will come
down, in the sight of all the people, upon Mount Sinai.&rdquo;
(Ex. xix. 10.)&nbsp; And thus Maimonides, a great authority in
the Jewish Law, says, that &lsquo;Israel was admitted into
covenant with God in three ways:&mdash;by circumcision, by
baptism, (alluding to this command, &ldquo;Let them wash their
clothes,&rdquo;) and by sacrifice.&rsquo;&nbsp; When any of the
heathen became proselytes to the Jewish religion, and sought
admission into the Jewish church, it is said that the males were
circumcised and baptized,&mdash;the females were
baptized,&mdash;and the children generally baptized with the
parents.&nbsp; And on the subject of the baptism of heathen
children, Maimonides again says, that &lsquo;if an Israelite
should find a Gentile infant, and baptize him in the name of a
proselyte, behold, he is a proselyte.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the precepts relating to ceremonial pollutions, the Jews
were rendered incapable of appearing before God in the tabernacle
or temple, till they were cleansed either by bathing or
sprinkling.&nbsp; In the Nineteenth Chapter of the Book of
Numbers the subject is particularly dwelt upon.&nbsp; When any
one was ceremonially unclean, it was enjoined, (v. 19,) that a
&ldquo;clean person should sprinkle upon the unclean&rdquo; (of
the water of separation before spoken of) &ldquo;on the third
day, and on the seventh day; <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and on the seventh day he&rdquo; (the
unclean) was to &ldquo;purify himself, and wash his clothes and
bathe himself in water,&rdquo; and then he was to be &ldquo;clean
at even.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; as it is added in the next verse,
&ldquo;the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
himself, <i>that soul shall be cut off from among the
congregation</i>, because he hath defiled the Sanctuary of the
Lord: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him;
he is unclean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Moses received directions from the Lord concerning the
consecration of Aaron and his sons, he was commanded (as we read
in Ex. xxix. 4,) to &ldquo;bring them unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water;&rdquo;
and then to put the Priestly garments upon them.&nbsp; In short,
by the law almost all things were purged by water, as well as by
blood;&mdash;the one having as distinct and definite a
signification as the other.&nbsp; And so familiar and forcible
was this figure of water among the Jews, that many of the
prophecies and promises relating to the Messiah and the spiritual
blessings to be enjoyed in the times of the gospel were couched
under it and conveyed by it.&nbsp; By Isaiah it is said of Him,
&ldquo;So shall He <i>sprinkle</i> many nations.&rdquo; (lii.
15.)&nbsp; And by the prophet Ezekiel the Lord
saith,&mdash;&ldquo;Then will I <i>sprinkle clean water</i> upon
you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all
your idols will I cleanse you.&nbsp; A new heart also will I give
you, and a new spirit will I put within you.&nbsp; And I will put
my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and
ye <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>shall
keep my judgments and do them.&rdquo; (xxxvi. 25&ndash;27.)</p>
<p>With this continued reference to water in connection with
spiritual things, before their eyes, the Jews were doubtless
prepared for its still farther use.&nbsp; Accordingly, when John
appeared as the forerunner of the Messiah, and baptized with
water all who were disposed to become his disciples, no surprise
was expressed at his doing it.&nbsp; He was asked indeed by the
Priests and Levites why he baptized, when they understood him as
denying himself to be any one of those whom they expected to be
sent by God.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou be not that Christ, nor Elias,
neither that prophet, why baptizest thou?&rdquo; (John i.
25.)&nbsp; But this only shews that they regarded baptism as a
natural evidence of a divine mission.&nbsp; Of John&rsquo;s
baptism we are told by himself, that it was a baptism unto
repentance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;baptize
you with water unto repentance.&rdquo; (Matt. iii. 11.)&nbsp; And
thus, all who were baptized of him &ldquo;confessed their
sins;&rdquo;&mdash;confession being a necessary part of
repentance.&nbsp; They also asked of him instruction as to their
conduct in future: and to the different classes of his disciples
he gave appropriate exhortations.&nbsp; In the account of
John&rsquo;s baptism in Acts xix. 4., it is added, that he
&ldquo;said unto the people, that they should believe on Him
which should come after him, that is, on Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus baptism was administered by John
<i>substantially</i> upon the same principle which afterwards
governed the Christian Church; namely, upon a profession (taken
to be <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>sincere) of repentance and the faith of the gospel.&nbsp;
For though the baptism of John was connected with a preparatory
dispensation, it was of an evangelical and very practical
character.&nbsp; He exposed the folly of trusting to outward
advantages;&mdash;taught men their need of a Saviour;&mdash;and
declared that nothing would satisfy God, and be accepted of Him,
but the bringing forth of good fruit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every tree
which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into
the fire.&rdquo; (Matt. iii. 10.)</p>
<p>When speaking of himself and of his baptism, John was
naturally led to speak of Him, to whom he came to bear witness:
and he said that He also would baptize, and in a manner to which
he (John) could make no pretension.&nbsp; &ldquo;I indeed baptize
you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is
mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: He shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire.&rdquo; (Matt. iii.
11.)&nbsp; Various expositions have been given of these latter
expressions.&nbsp; That they refer (among other meanings) to the
outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, which was
accompanied with &ldquo;cloven tongues like as of fire,&rdquo;
sitting upon each of the Apostles, and by which they were enabled
to speak in languages they had never learned,&mdash;and to the
gift of divers kinds of tongues on other occasions, as in the
case of Cornelius and his company,&mdash;is evident from what is
said upon the subject in Acts i. 5. and xi. 15, 16.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be
baptized with the Holy <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Ghost not many days
hence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And as I (Peter) began to speak, the
Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.&nbsp; Then
remembered I the word of the Lord, how that He said, John indeed
baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the expressions, &ldquo;with the Holy
Ghost and fire,&rdquo; have probably a still more extensive
signification.&nbsp; No element is more subtle and powerful than
fire: changing whatever it comes in contact with into its own
nature.&nbsp; Thus fire (like water and wind, both of which are
also made emblems of the Holy Spirit,) will represent the
efficacy of Divine grace; its enlightening, purifying, refining
and inflaming power; and so it forms a striking and happy
contrast to that destroying fire, spoken of in the former and the
following verses.&nbsp; And hereby would be fulfilled the
prophecies of Isaiah and Malachi:&mdash;&ldquo;When the Lord
shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and
shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof
by the Spirit of judgment <i>and by the Spirit of
burning</i>.&rdquo; (Is. iv. 4.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord, whom
ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple: He is <i>like a
refiner&rsquo;s fire</i>, and like fuller&rsquo;s soap.&nbsp; And
He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and He shall
purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that
they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.&rdquo;
(Mal. iii. 1&ndash;3.)&nbsp; Or, the baptism of fire, if taken in
connection with the context, would signify the desolating
judgments of God upon the <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>hardened Jews: or it might represent
the afflictions which Christ&rsquo;s true followers were to
suffer.&nbsp; To these He referred, when He said to the two sons
of Zebedee, &ldquo;With the baptism that I am baptized withal
shall ye be baptized.&rdquo; (Mark x. 39.)</p>
<p>To the baptism of John, Jesus Himself submitted.&nbsp; The
reason He gave to John for this was, &ldquo;Thus it becometh us
to fulfil all righteousness:&rdquo; (Matt, iii. 15.) hereby
inculcating the duty of attention to whatever God hath commanded;
and intimating His solemn entrance upon His Priestly Office,
according to the directions which God gave to Moses concerning
the washing of Aaron and his sons with water, as already referred
to. (Ex. xxix. 4.)&nbsp; Occasion was also hereby afforded for
the fulfilment of the sign given to John for the discovery of the
Messiah: &ldquo;Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending,
and remaining upon Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the
Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; And John &ldquo;saw, and bare record
that this was the Son of God.&rdquo; (John i. 33, 34.)</p>
<p>After His own baptism by John, and His choice of the twelve
Apostles, Jesus also baptized those who became His
disciples.&nbsp; But <i>the fact itself</i> is all that is
recorded.&nbsp; Water was evidently used; but we are not told any
thing of the time when He began to baptize, nor of the
description of persons baptized, nor of the mode and form of His
baptism, nor of what followed after it.&nbsp; We are simply
informed in John iii. 22., as a part of the gospel-narrative,
that &ldquo;Jesus and His disciples <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>came into the land of Judea, and there
He tarried with them and baptized.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the only
farther mention of the subject is in reference to a report,
&ldquo;that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than
John,&rdquo; and that Jesus Himself did not administer the
Ordinance in person, but that His disciples (meaning probably the
twelve) baptized for Him. (John iv. 1, 2.)&nbsp; This is all that
the Scripture says upon the subject.&nbsp; <i>Why</i> the Lord
did not baptize with His own hands, we are not informed.&nbsp; It
could not have been lest any should say that He had baptized in
His own name; for men came to His baptism avowedly <i>as His
disciples</i>.&nbsp; But <i>for obvious reasons</i> He chose to
employ Himself in preaching, and the twelve in baptizing those
whom He had taught: as He afterwards sent St. Paul &ldquo;not to
baptize, but to preach the gospel.&rdquo; (1 Cor. i. 15.)&nbsp;
He would also wish to prevent <i>the preference</i> which would
doubtless have been given to <i>His own</i> administration of the
Ordinance.</p>
<p>Of the baptism of the twelve disciples themselves we have no
account.&nbsp; As the baptism of John was so general, it is
probable that they, or the greater number of them, had partaken
of it.&nbsp; Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, undoubtedly
had.&nbsp; He was one of the two of John&rsquo;s disciples who
heard him say of Jesus, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God!&rdquo; and
who was afterwards one of the twelve.&nbsp; It probably was the
case with others of them also.&nbsp; But nothing is said
respecting them.&nbsp; Tertullian observes, that with regard to
them,&mdash;(the twelve)&mdash;<a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;the peculiar privilege of the
first accession to discipleship, and of the individual
familiarity to which they were admitted with Him, had power to
confer on them <i>the compendium</i> of baptism;&rdquo; the sum
and substance of it.</p>
<p>No other mention is made of baptism by the Evangelists, until
we come to the Commission which the Lord gave to His Apostles
after His resurrection from the dead, except in one passage,
which occurs in the report of His memorable conversation with
Nicodemus, the Jewish ruler, contained in the Third Chapter of
the Gospel according to St. John.&nbsp; Nicodemus having come to
Jesus with the avowed desire to be instructed by Him, as &ldquo;a
teacher come from God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus answered and said unto
him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again,
he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; (v. 3.)&nbsp; Nicodemus
expresses his surprise at this saying, and asks, &ldquo;How can a
man be born when he is old?&rdquo;&mdash;evidently shewing that
he did not at all comprehend its meaning.&nbsp; Upon which the
Lord repeats the asseveration, with some addition to it:
&ldquo;Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.&rdquo; (v. 5.)&nbsp; In this instance, as in
every other, our endeavour shall be, to ascertain what the words
of Scripture do really and simply mean.&nbsp; If there had been
no intention on the part of Christ to make baptism with water an
Ordinance of His Church or Kingdom upon earth, the expressions,
&ldquo;born of water and of the Spirit,&rdquo; might <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>still have
been used by Him with great propriety; as John the Baptist had
previously used the words, &ldquo;He shall baptize you <i>with
the Holy Ghost and fire</i>:&rdquo; water being, as well as fire,
an appropriate and beautiful emblem of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; If
the &ldquo;cloven tongues like as of fire,&rdquo; had <i>not</i>
rested upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost, the words of
the Baptist, just referred to, had yet been strikingly applicable
to the operations of the Holy Ghost; and the figure would have
lost none of its force and fitness.&nbsp; Water too, in like
manner, might have been connected by Christ with the mention of
the Spirit, because of the similarity between their
effects.&nbsp; But inasmuch as Christ Himself had been baptized,
and was about to continue baptism in His Church, (not only during
His personal Ministry upon earth, but when, after His return to
Heaven, His gospel should be preached among all nations,) and as
John&rsquo;s baptism had been so general, and had drawn so much
attention to the subject,&mdash;it is reasonable to conclude,
that when Jesus spake to Nicodemus of a man&rsquo;s being
&ldquo;born of water,&rdquo; He meant his being baptized; and it
is probable that Nicodemus, who knew well that baptism had been
already used in the admission of proselytes into the Jewish
Church, at once so understood His words.&nbsp; For, if not
<i>altogether figurative</i>, some specific act must have been
meant; and what could this be, but baptism?&nbsp; No explanation,
therefore, was given to Nicodemus of the terms, &ldquo;born of
water,&rdquo; because none was needed.&nbsp; Having begun, in v.
3, to speak of <i>a </i><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span><i>birth</i>, the Lord Jesus
continues the same idea, and applies it to the other subject
which He wished to introduce, namely, baptism.&nbsp; And this is
not the only instance of the use of such phraseology: for, when
arguing with the Sadducees about the raising of the dead, He says
of the just, that they are &ldquo;<i>the children of
God</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;and then, carrying on the idea, He calls
them, &ldquo;<i>the children of the resurrection</i>.&rdquo;
(Luke xx. 36.)&nbsp; To be &ldquo;born of water,&rdquo; then, is
to be baptized with water; and this, together with being
&ldquo;born of the Spirit,&rdquo; Christ declares to be necessary
to an entrance into &ldquo;the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
&ldquo;the Kingdom of God&rdquo; is here meant the Visible Church
of Christ upon earth; the members of which are therein prepared
for the state of eternal glory in Heaven.&nbsp; This shows us of
what characters Christ designed His Visible Church to consist;
namely, of those who are born of the Spirit, and baptized with
water.&nbsp; And thus the true Church of Christ may well be
described as &lsquo;<i>A Congregation of faithful men</i>, in the
which the pure word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be
duly ministered according to Christ&rsquo;s
Ordinance.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Article XIX. of the Church of
England.)&nbsp; Christ would have His Church a Visible Body, that
it might be &ldquo;The Pillar and Ground of the
truth;&rdquo;&mdash;to maintain the truth and to hold it forth to
the world.&nbsp; As there had been before His coming, so it was
meet that there should continue to be, an associated and
authorized Body of God&rsquo;s Worshippers and Witnesses, to
which additions might from time to time be made of &ldquo;such as
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>should be
saved,&rdquo; (Acts ii. 47.), and by which Christ&rsquo;s
religion might be spread abroad and propagated.&nbsp; Into this
Body &lsquo;faithful men,&rsquo; or those who are &ldquo;born
again,&rdquo; are incorporated by baptism.&nbsp; And it is of
this spiritual kingdom, which &ldquo;is not of this world,&rdquo;
that Christ speaks in the verse we are now considering.&nbsp; The
Kingdom of God, or the Kingdom of Heaven, has sometimes in
Scripture a more extensive signification, and includes both good
and bad,&mdash;the true Israel and those &ldquo;which say they
are Jews and are not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since man cannot know the
heart of his fellow-man, he must accept his profession, where it
is not contradicted by plain and palpable evidence: and hence it
comes to pass, that &lsquo;in the Visible Church the evil will be
mingled with the good.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Article XXVI.)&nbsp; But
Christ, the Great Head of the Church, does not acknowledge the
evil as belonging to Him, or as having any right to a place in
His Church or kingdom.&nbsp; Where has He ever prescribed or
demanded or allowed <i>a merely external profession and
service</i>?&nbsp; What did He say to those who were satisfied
with this?&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Ye hypocrites</i>, well did Esaias
prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with
their mouth and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is
far from me!&rdquo; (Matt. xv. 7, 8.)&nbsp; And if this spiritual
service, this service of the heart, was required of <i>the
Jews</i>, and evidently symbolized by their distinguishing
Ordinance of circumcision, and if <i>they</i> were branded by the
Lord as &ldquo;hypocrites&rdquo; who did not pay it,&mdash;no
wonder that it should be designed and <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>required by the Gospel!&nbsp;
Otherwise, Christ would be the minister of hypocrisy, formality,
and sin!&nbsp; But He Himself has told us, that He soweth <i>good
seed</i> only in His field; and that it is His enemy who sows
<i>the tares</i>. (Matt. xiii. 37, 38.)&nbsp; The wicked and such
as be void of a lively faith, and all who &ldquo;have a form of
godliness but denying the power thereof,&rdquo; are considered as
<i>intruders</i> into the Church of Christ, and as such will be
dealt with by Him at the last.&nbsp; This was God&rsquo;s
complaint of His Church of old:&mdash;&ldquo;Among my people are
found wicked men!&rdquo; (Jer. v. 26.)&nbsp; And He remonstrates
with such characters for professing that they knew Him, while
their conduct was inconsistent with their profession.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do that thou
shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?&rdquo; (Ps. l.
16.)&nbsp; And the Lord Jesus saith the same to such like
persons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the
things which I say?&rdquo; (Luke vi. 46.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Friend,
how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment?&rdquo;
(Matt, xxii. 12.)&nbsp; And He declares that in the last day He
&ldquo;will profess unto them, I never knew you.&rdquo; (Matt,
vii. 23.)&nbsp; He calls them &ldquo;goats,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;sheep;&rdquo; though while on earth they find admittance
into His fold. (Matt. xxv. 33.)&nbsp; Of such is <i>not</i> the
kingdom of God.&nbsp; The Kingdom of God, or &lsquo;the Visible
Church of Christ, is <i>a Congregation of faithful
men</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, to enter into this kingdom, or, which
is the same thing, to be an ostensible member of this spiritual
Society, a man must be &ldquo;born of water and of <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one can be a <i>real</i> and
<i>recognised</i> member of Christ&rsquo;s Church on earth,
except he be baptized and born of the Spirit.&nbsp; The necessity
of being &ldquo;born of the Spirit&rdquo; in order to our
becoming the subjects of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom is shown by Him
in what immediately follows.&nbsp; &ldquo;That which is born of
the flesh is flesh:&rdquo;&mdash;(v. 6.) that which proceeds from
and is produced by carnal and corrupt nature is carnal and
corrupt also.&nbsp; Hence the necessity of a great and thorough
change.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye <i>must</i> be <i>born again</i>.&rdquo;
(v. 7.)&nbsp; Of this change the Holy Spirit is&mdash;to keep up
the idea introduced by Christ&mdash;the Parent or Father.&nbsp;
And as that which generates, generates its like, so &ldquo;that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit:&rdquo; in other
words,&mdash;the abstract being here used by Christ for the
concrete, (and by its use He more strongly expresses the reality
of what might justly be called <i>a birth</i> and the
communication of <i>an entirely new nature</i>,)&mdash;he that
partakes of this birth of the Spirit is thereby made a spiritual
man, whereas before he was a carnal and corrupt man.&nbsp; And
since Christ came (as we have seen) to set up a spiritual
kingdom, (for &ldquo;the kingdom of God is righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;&rdquo;) (Rom. xiv. 17,) none
can <i>really</i> belong to this kingdom, except spiritual
persons.&nbsp; And to this agrees what the Lord said on another
occasion; &ldquo;Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child, <i>he shall not
enter therein</i>.&rdquo; (Mark x. 15.)&nbsp; And if not real
members of His <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Kingdom on earth, we shall certainly not enter into His
Kingdom of glory.&nbsp; But to be <i>recognised</i> as well as
<i>real</i> members of His Church, or subjects of His kingdom, we
must be &ldquo;born of water,&rdquo; or baptized.&nbsp; This is
Christ&rsquo;s appointed Ordinance.&nbsp; He ordained the use of
it in His Church, while He was present with His disciples, and He
subsequently enjoined the same in the case of all who should
believe His gospel.&nbsp; Baptism with water, therefore, is not
to be omitted, wherever it may be had.&nbsp; And, surely, the
reason which Jesus Himself gave to John for seeking this
Ordinance, ought to influence those who desire to be numbered
among His friends and followers: &ldquo;Thus it becometh us to
fulfil all righteousness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while these two things, baptism and the birth of the
Spirit, are declared by Christ to be necessary to a certain
end,&mdash;namely, an entrance into the Kingdom of God, or
Visible Church of Christ upon earth,&mdash;there is not the
slightest intimation given by Him that they are
<i>necessarily</i> connected with each other.&nbsp; Not a word is
said by Him from which we can deduce this.&nbsp; Two things are
often required for a definite purpose;&mdash;two witnesses, for
instance, to prove a fact;&mdash;an invitation and a
wedding-garment to entitle any one to be a guest at a
marriage-feast;&mdash;but these may be quite independent of one
another.&nbsp; It cannot be pretended that <i>one thing only</i>
is spoken of by Christ.&nbsp; The birth of the Spirit is twice
mentioned by itself, and once in connection with baptism by
water.&nbsp; Baptism, then, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and the birth of Spirit are clearly
not identical,&mdash;not one and the same thing.&nbsp; And
<i>their necessary connection</i> is neither here, nor any where
else in Scripture, asserted.&nbsp; It is a statement, not
supported by a tittle of evidence; but, on the other hand,
contradicted by express testimonies of Scripture, and by very
general experience.&nbsp; The putting of these two things
together in one sentence is surely no proof of their necessary
connection.&nbsp; Had the two been necessarily
connected,&mdash;had baptism been the appointed channel for the
conveyance of the Spirit, Christ would undoubtedly have said
so.&nbsp; Or rather, it would have been sufficient for Him to
have said, &ldquo;Except a man <i>be baptized</i>, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God;&rdquo; and He certainly would not
have omitted the mention of baptism, as He did omit it, in His
first solemn asseveration to Nicodemus.&nbsp; The necessity of
<i>the birth of the Spirit</i> was evidently what Jesus wished to
enforce upon His inquirer.&nbsp; This therefore was the
<i>first</i> thing spoken of by Him.&nbsp; In His second address
He introduces water-baptism; as this would serve to make the
spiritual subject clearer, and because He would show that baptism
was henceforth to be the token of the Covenant: but how Nicodemus
was to conclude from the manner in which it was mentioned, that
water was to be the means of communicating the new birth, or that
the two things were always to be found together, it is not easy
to imagine.&nbsp; Especially as in the very same address he was
told, that, in giving the new birth, the Holy <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Spirit acts
as &ldquo;the wind <i>blowing where it listeth</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now baptism must always be administered <i>at a specific
time</i>; but is this the case with the blowing of the
wind?&nbsp; Did Christ then use an inappropriate metaphor?&nbsp;
He plainly tells Nicodemus, that as &ldquo;a master of
Israel&rdquo; he ought to have understood what He was speaking
of.&nbsp; But what is there in the Old Testament from which
Nicodemus could have learned the necessary connection of the new
birth with any outward Ordinance?&nbsp; Was the circumcision of
the heart always connected with the circumcision of the
flesh?&nbsp; Had not the Lord, in the time of Moses, bidden the
people of Israel to &ldquo;circumcise the foreskin of their
hearts&rdquo;? (Deut. x. 16.)&nbsp; And had He not said of them
by Jeremiah, &ldquo;All the house of Israel are uncircumcised in
the heart&rdquo;? (ix. 26.)&nbsp; <i>This</i> was the doctrine to
which Nicodemus had been accustomed:&mdash;<i>the necessity</i>
of both the outward and the inward circumcision, but <i>not</i>
their necessary connection with each other.&nbsp; So likewise
with the new birth and baptism.</p>
<p>And as Scripture is, and must be, consistent with Scripture,
let the latter part of Christ&rsquo;s address to Nicodemus be
compared with His subsequent directions concerning baptism, and
compared also with the writings of His Apostles, and it will be
seen, that <i>faith in Him</i>, which He so frequently mentions
as leading to salvation, <i>is that with which the birth of the
Spirit is connected</i>, and that <i>this faith is invariably
required before the administration of the Ordinance to
any</i>.&nbsp; How then can baptism <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>with water convey the birth of the
Spirit, unless Christ and His Apostles be at issue with each
other, and the order of things, which He Himself appointed in His
Church, be inverted?&nbsp; St. John expressly declares in his
Gospel, (i. 12, 13.) that &ldquo;as many as received Him, (Jesus
Christ) to them <i>gave He power to become the sons of God</i>,
even <i>to them that believe on His name</i>; which were born,
not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in his First Epistle, (v.
1.)&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Whosoever believeth</i> that Jesus is the
Christ <i>is born of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the order which
Christ intended for the administration of baptism by His Apostles
was thus laid down for them;&mdash;&ldquo;He that believeth and
is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they acted
accordingly.&nbsp; No statement was ever more capable of proof
than this, that the birth of the Spirit may be without baptism,
and baptism without the birth of the Spirit.&nbsp; Can any doubt,
that the penitent thief on the cross was &ldquo;born of the
Spirit,&rdquo; who yet was not baptized?&nbsp; Can any venture to
affirm, that Simon Magus, though baptized, was &ldquo;born of the
Spirit&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did not Peter tell him, that he &ldquo;had
neither part nor lot in the matter, for his heart was not right
in the sight of God&rdquo;?&nbsp; Man must not put asunder what
God hath joined together; but neither must he of his own
authority join together what God hath left asunder.&nbsp; We
cannot be in manifested communion with the Church of Christ, if
we wilfully neglect the Ordinance which He appointed for His
disciples; <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>but we may be baptized, or &ldquo;born of water&rdquo;
and so be in professed communion with His Church, as Simon Magus
was, and yet be, like him, void of a lively faith and the
inspiration of Christ&rsquo;s Spirit.&nbsp; As it has been well
observed upon this subject; &lsquo;It would violate the
principles of common sense and confound all specific modes of
instruction, to call that <i>a birth</i> at which nothing was
born, and that person <i>new-born</i> whose moral principles had
received no change.&rsquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a
href="#footnote20" class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; The notion of
an initial act&mdash;of the communication of something in
baptism, which may never be perceived, and never produce any holy
fruit,&mdash;has no sanction from Sacred Scripture.&nbsp; Our
Lord here says nothing like it.&nbsp; He speaks of <i>a second
birth</i>,&mdash;<i>a new existence</i>,&mdash;and that of a
spiritual nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>That which is born of the
Spirit is spirit</i>&rdquo; (v. 6.)&nbsp; The language is the
same as that which describes a man&rsquo;s own entrance into this
world of life and activity.&nbsp; And His Apostles, when writing
of this spiritual birth, always ascribe to it perceptible and
powerful effects.&nbsp; &ldquo;We know,&rdquo; writes St. John,
(1 Ep. v. 18,) &ldquo;that whosoever is born of God sinneth not;
but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked
one toucheth him not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, (v. 4,)
&ldquo;Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; And again, (iii. 10,) &ldquo;<i>In this</i>
the children of God <i>are manifest</i>, and the children of the
devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if the birth of the <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Spirit, by
which men are made the children of God, necessarily accompany
baptism, they may be at one and the same time the children of God
and the children of the devil!&nbsp; They may be the children of
God, as being born of His Spirit in baptism, and they may be
&ldquo;manifested&rdquo; to be the children of the devil by
committing sin; for thousands who have been baptized never show
the least spiritual disposition, but live and die under the
dominion of iniquity!&nbsp; But it is said, &lsquo;The Spirit was
given to them, and they lost it:&mdash;they were God&rsquo;s
children, but they ceased to be such.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can
<i>that</i>, with a shadow of reason, be said to have been
<i>lost</i>, of the possession of which there never was the
slightest evidence?&nbsp; Can <i>that</i>, with any propriety, be
said to <i>cease</i>, which, if the statement of the Apostle is
to be the standard of judgment, never began?&nbsp; &ldquo;In
this,&rdquo; says St. John, &ldquo;the children of God <i>are
manifest</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of thousands who have been baptized it
may be asked, when were they <i>manifested</i> to be the children
of God?&nbsp; And the answer of truth must be,
<i>Never</i>.&nbsp; They <i>never</i> did
righteousness:&mdash;they <i>always</i> committed sin.&nbsp; They
were never therefore &ldquo;born of God:&rdquo;&mdash;they never
partook of the birth of the Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;They went out
from us,&rdquo; St. John says again of some who had been nominal
members of the Christian Church, &ldquo;they went out from us,
but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would
no doubt have continued with us.&rdquo; (1 Ep. ii. 19.)&nbsp; The
only <i>seminal</i> principle of grace which the Scripture
recognizes, is that, which this same Apostle speaks of; (iii.
9.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever is born of God <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span><i>doth not
commit sin</i>, <i>for his seed remaineth in him</i>; <i>and he
cannot sin</i>, <i>because he is born of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is in perfect harmony with Christ&rsquo;s words to
Nicodemus;&mdash;&ldquo;The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
<i>thou hearest the sound thereof</i>:&rdquo; thou knowest that
it is blowing by the effects which it produces: &ldquo;<i>so</i>
is every one who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo; (v. 8.)&nbsp; But
to believe that &ldquo;the wind bloweth,&rdquo; when a leaf is
not shaken, nor the slightest murmur in the air heard, is so
contradictory to the evidence of the senses, that after this we
might believe anything.&nbsp; Transubstantiation itself need not
be rejected by us.&nbsp; Why not believe a <i>material</i> as
well as a <i>moral</i> change, if the exercise of the
understanding and of the senses is to be excluded?&nbsp; Nay,
transubstantiation has a greater show of Scripture-authority in
its favour.&nbsp; Christ <i>did say</i> of the bread and wine,
&ldquo;This is my Body;&rdquo; &ldquo;This is my Blood:&rdquo;
but He never said, &ldquo;Every one who is born of water is born
also of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The uniform tenor of His
teaching was, that men&rsquo;s profession and principles and
privileges should be tried by their practical effects.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By their fruits ye shall know them.&rdquo; (Matt. vii.
20.)&nbsp; And as transubstantiation might as well be believed,
as that every baptized person is necessarily &ldquo;born of the
Spirit,&rdquo; so, to claim the power of absolutely setting God
on work to new-create the soul in baptism, is little short of the
presumption of the Church of Rome, which asserts the power of her
priests to turn the bread and wine in the Sacrament of the Supper
into Christ&rsquo;s <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>real Body and Blood!&nbsp; It would <i>not</i> then be
true, (as declared in John i. 13,) that &ldquo;the sons of God we
born, <i>not of the will of man</i>;&rdquo; for baptism is
administered <i>at the will of man</i>;&mdash;whensoever and to
whomsoever he pleases.</p>
<p>The next thing to be noticed in Scripture in connection with
this subject, is <i>the Charge or Commission</i> which the Lord
Jesus gave to His Apostles after His resurrection from the dead
and before His ascension into Heaven.&nbsp; In Matt, xxviii. 19.,
we find the Lord saying to the Eleven, &ldquo;Go ye therefore and
teach all nations;&rdquo;&mdash;or, as it is in the margin,
&ldquo;make disciples of all
nations;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In Mark xvi. 15, 16., the Commission to the Eleven is thus given;
&ldquo;And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world and preach
the Gospel to every creature.&nbsp; He that believeth and is
baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be
damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now in both these passages the same course
is prescribed, which had been previously adopted by Christ
Himself and by His forerunner, John the Baptist.&nbsp; They
(Christ and John) first made disciples; and then baptized them,
in token of their being disciples.&nbsp; And the Apostles were to
do the same.&nbsp; They were first to preach the gospel, and
then, when any believed it,&mdash;or, as God only knoweth the
hearts, (for the discerning of spirits was not possessed by
<i>all</i> who preached the gospel, <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and does not appear to have been
exercised in ordinary ministrations,) when any professed to
believe it, without giving cause for a suspicion of insincerity,
they were to baptize them; and when the profession was sincere,
the promise of salvation was <i>assured</i> unto them.&nbsp; And
according to these directions the Apostles and other preachers of
the gospel acted.&nbsp; The Jews had hitherto been the peculiar
people and Church of God.&nbsp; But this state of things was to
last no longer.&nbsp; The gospel was certainly to be <i>first</i>
preached to the Jews, but not to be confined to them.&nbsp; It
was to be preached &ldquo;to every creature.&rdquo;&mdash;All
nations were to hear the glad tidings of salvation by Jesus
Christ, and to be called to &ldquo;the obedience of
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Repentance and remission of sins were
to be preached in Christ&rsquo;s name among all
nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The teaching</i>, then, which preceded
baptism, and by which disciples were made to Christ, was <i>the
preaching of the gospel</i>.&nbsp; (Of this we have a direct
proof in Acts xiv. 21.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when they (Paul and
Barnabas) <i>had preached the gospel to that city and had taught
many</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;or, as the latter word properly signifies,
&ldquo;had brought many to the faith of Christ and made them His
disciples.&rdquo;)&nbsp; And when the gospel was believed, the
Sacrament of baptism was to be administered, and then farther
instruction to be given in all things which Christ willed that
His disciples should do.&nbsp; For thus continuing baptism as the
outward and visible token of believing upon Him, the Lord Jesus
gave no reason.&nbsp; The Ordinance, in fact, spake for
itself.&nbsp; The design of <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Christ&rsquo;s death being to
&ldquo;redeem from all iniquity, and to purify unto Himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works,&rdquo; what outward rite
could more suitably be enjoined upon those who became His
disciples, than the washing with pure water?&nbsp; As we have
seen already, every proselyte to the Jews&rsquo; religion from
among the heathen was washed, or baptized, as well as
circumcised.&nbsp; In founding the New Testament Church, which
was to consist of some of all nations on equal terms with the
Jews, the Lord lays aside the distinguishing Ordinance of the Old
Testament Church,&mdash;circumcision,&mdash;and retains that
which was <i>its appendage</i> in the case of Gentile converts,
namely, baptism.&nbsp; And how delightfully consonant with the
character of the New Dispensation was this proceeding!&nbsp;
Instead of the painful and bloody rite of circumcision, water
only is used;&mdash;pleasant and refreshing; and moreover, still
more significant: for while circumcision conveyed only the
<i>negative</i> idea of the putting away of sin, baptism includes
both the removal of uncleanness and the production of its
opposite state of purity.&nbsp; In the Commission, then, which
the Lord gave to His Apostles, we notice these two
things:&mdash;first, the universal proclamation to be made of the
gospel; and secondly, the limitation of baptism to those who
should believe it.&nbsp; No mention is made of the manner in
which baptism was to be administered, (of <i>the form of
words</i> we shall speak presently) nor is there any distinction
of country, condition, sex or age.&nbsp; Every one who should be
willing to give <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>in his name to Christ and to be saved by Him, was to
partake of the rite of baptism.&nbsp; And this seems the proper
place for the remark, that as the use of water was thus made
common to both Dispensations, and as no new directions were
given, the Apostles would naturally be led to pursue the course
which had previously prevailed with respect to the baptism of
proselytes to the Jews&rsquo; religion.&nbsp; These proselytes
had been worshippers of idols, and were therefore to be washed or
baptized, in token of their putting away of their idolatry and
its accompanying impurities.&nbsp; Proselytes to
Christ&mdash;from all but the Jewish people&mdash;would be of the
same description.&nbsp; Circumcision was to cease, and baptism
with water alone to be retained, and to be applied alike to Jews
and Gentiles.&nbsp; Why then should not the same course be
pursued as heretofore?&nbsp; If the children of proselytes had
been for the most part baptized with their parents, why should
not the same be continued?&mdash;The children of believing Jews
had received circumcision when eight days old, as the token of
the Covenant.&nbsp; Why should the children of those Jews who
believed in Christ,&mdash;in whom that very Covenant was
confirmed, of which circumcision was the token,&mdash;why should
the children of these believing Jews not have the token of the
Covenant, as well as the children of their believing
forefathers?&nbsp; The Covenant is one and the same.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord said to Abraham, I will establish my Covenant
between me and thee and thy seed after thee, in their
generations, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and to thy
seed after thee.&nbsp; And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed
after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, for an
everlasting possession.&rdquo; (Gen. xvii. 7, 8.)&nbsp; These
promises were made to Abraham, as &ldquo;the father of all them
that should believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first thing here promised
is, that &ldquo;the Lord would be a God unto Abraham and his
seed.&rdquo; <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; And do not the words of Christ,
when He commanded His Apostles to baptize those who should become
His disciples, <i>convey the same
idea</i>?&mdash;&ldquo;baptizing them in, or into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&rdquo;?&nbsp; What
is this but a declaration, that the Triune Jehovah should be
their God?&nbsp; The other part of the promise is, that
&ldquo;Canaan&rdquo; should be their &ldquo;everlasting
possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; This by St. Paul is called a
&ldquo;promise, that he should be the heir of the
world:&rdquo;&mdash;which chiefly meant, that he and his true
seed should inherit Heaven.&nbsp; And does not St. Paul <i>decide
the question</i> as to the continuance of Abraham&rsquo;s
Covenant by asserting, that believers in Christ are heirs of
Heaven <i>in virtue of this very promise made to
Abraham</i>?&nbsp; &ldquo;If ye be Christ&rsquo;s, then are ye
Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and heirs according to the promise.&rdquo;
(Gal. iii. 29.)&nbsp; The Covenant being thus the same, were
children not to be brought into the blessings and the bond of it,
<i>simply because the token of it was changed</i>?&nbsp; If (as
it has been often observed on this <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>subject) the Lord had been pleased to
continue the original token of the Covenant made with Abraham,
and had commanded His Apostles and Ministers to circumcise, in
the place of baptizing, all who should embrace His gospel, would
they not have continued the practice of the Jewish Church, and
have circumcised the children of all believing parents?&nbsp; How
much rather then, when He saith, Wash; simply baptize with
water;&mdash;it is my will, that this mild but significant
element and emblem be henceforth exclusively used in my
Church!&nbsp; And having been hitherto used in the admission of
Gentile proselytes into the Jewish Church, it forms a connection
with the Covenant made with Abraham, <i>more manifest</i> than
any new Ordinance could possibly have done.&nbsp; Therefore there
was no need of any directions respecting the baptism of infants,
as this would naturally follow upon the continuance of the
Abrahamic Covenant.&nbsp; Nay, after all that had taken place, if
Christ had not intended that the children of believers should
partake of this Sacrament, as well as the parents, a prohibition
to this effect would have been needed.&nbsp; But nothing of the
kind was given.&nbsp; On the contrary, (to pass on for a moment
to another portion of Scripture,) the very first day on which the
Apostles began to execute the Commission which Christ had given
them, Peter said to those who expressed a desire to become
Christ&rsquo;s disciples, &ldquo;<i>The promise is unto you and
to your children</i>.&rdquo; (Acts ii. 39.)&nbsp; This certainly
did not look like an intention of excluding children from sharing
with their parents in the Ordinances of the Church of God!</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>It has
been stated, that some farther notice would be taken of <i>the
form of words</i> to be used in the administration of
baptism.&nbsp; Whether the Lord Jesus meant, that the precise
form, &ldquo;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; should invariably be employed, may admit
of a question.&nbsp; Baptized persons were doubtless dedicated to
the service of the glorious and blessed Trinity.&nbsp; They were
baptized <i>into</i> the name of the Triune God.&nbsp; But it
cannot be certainly proved, that the Lord Jesus intended that
these very words should be used on each occasion.&nbsp; And it is
remarkable, that in the subsequent account of instances of
baptism in The Acts of the Apostles, it is called &ldquo;being
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Iren&aelig;us observes, that this might be the putting of a part
for the whole, and that so it would be generally
understood.&nbsp; The safest course has, however, been taken in
the Christian Church by the retention of <i>the precise form</i>
found in the Commission given by Christ to His Apostles; and no
objection can be justly brought against it.</p>
<p>This is all that is found in The Gospels, <i>directly</i>
applicable to the Sacrament of Baptism.</p>
<p>But there is a circumstance recorded in three of them, which
cannot be overlooked in connection with the subject of the
administration of baptism to children;&mdash;though baptism
itself is not mentioned in it.&nbsp; St. Matthew, St. Mark, and
St. Luke, relate the bringing of little children or infants, or
both, either by their parents or others interested for them, to
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Christ,
&ldquo;that He should put His hands on them and pray for
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The disciples, unwilling probably that their
Master should be troubled with such an application,
&ldquo;rebuked those who brought them: but when Jesus saw it, He
was much displeased&rdquo; with the disciples, &ldquo;and said
unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid
them not; for of such is the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Verily I say
unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
little child, he shall not enter therein.&nbsp; And He took them
up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.&rdquo;
(Mark x. 13&ndash;16.)&nbsp; What doubtless increased
Christ&rsquo;s displeasure at the conduct of His disciples was
their evident forgetfulness of what had passed a short time
before; when, a dispute having arisen among them who should be
the greatest, He set a child in the midst of them and proposed
him as a pattern of humility, unto which He declared all the
subjects of His kingdom must be conformed.&nbsp; With respect to
the children thus brought to Christ, He only acted in His usual
benevolent manner, when He complied with the request made of Him
concerning them.&nbsp; He was asked to &ldquo;put His hands on
them and to pray,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, for a blessing to rest
upon them.&nbsp; This therefore He did.&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo;&mdash;He &ldquo;blessed
them&rdquo;&mdash;is the same with that used by Himself in His
sermon on the Mount: &ldquo;bless them that curse
you:&rdquo;&mdash;the meaning of which is, &lsquo;Pray that
blessings may come upon those who call down curses upon
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when Jesus <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>blessed the children which were
brought to Him, He commended them by prayer to the compassion and
favour of His heavenly Father.&nbsp; This is all that we can
legitimately conclude from what is here said.&nbsp; Jesus
manifested the same kindness of heart towards the rich young
ruler, mentioned immediately afterwards; when &ldquo;beholding
him, He loved him;&rdquo; though this object of His love went
away from Him, and there is every reason to fear that his riches
proved the cause of his ruin.&nbsp; The same disposition of
benevolence which led the Lord Jesus to pray for the children
that were brought to Him, led Him also to pray for His murderers;
for while hanging on the cross, He cried, &ldquo;Father, forgive
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, were all that were engaged in putting Him
to death really forgiven?&nbsp; Did not many of them continue in
impenitence and unbelief?&nbsp; Undoubtedly they did.&nbsp; It is
impossible, therefore, to conclude <i>absolutely</i> that even
these children which were brought to Christ were <i>eternally
saved</i>, whatever <i>hope</i> and charitable opinion may be
entertained on the subject.&nbsp; But He farther said respecting
them,&mdash;&ldquo;Of such is the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What then did He mean by this declaration?&nbsp; It is to be
observed, that this was said by Jesus of these children, <i>not
after</i> they had been brought to Him and blessed by Him, but
<i>before</i> they were so brought, and <i>as the reason why they
should be brought to Him</i>: &ldquo;For of such is the kingdom
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it is evident that Christ does not say
this of children as they are <i>by nature</i>.&nbsp; He Himself
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>had before
described the heart of man, that is, the nature of man, as full
of all evil.&nbsp; (See Mark vii. 26.)&nbsp; And though these
children might have been circumcised, yet <i>this</i> does not
appear to have been contemplated by Christ when He spake of them:
and we know from what St. Paul says, as well as from other
Scriptures, that the outward circumcision was by no means always
accompanied with the circumcision of the heart.&nbsp; Nor does
there appear to have been anything <i>peculiar</i> in this case,
to which Christ&rsquo;s observations were confined.&nbsp; If so,
<i>we</i> should have nothing whatever to do with it.&nbsp; It
seems to be of children, <i>as children</i>, that He here
speaks;&mdash;not of <i>children brought to Him</i>, (as already
noticed) but of <i>children in general</i>: &ldquo;Of such is the
kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words, <i>strictly taken</i>,
would intimate, that they were in the kingdom of God already; for
He does not say this of them <i>after</i> that they had been
blessed by Him, but He says it of them <i>before</i>.&nbsp; It
was not, therefore, <i>His reception of them</i> which caused Him
to speak thus concerning them.&nbsp; The true view of the subject
seems to be this;&mdash;that, while the whole transaction wears a
kind and gracious aspect toward man&rsquo;s helpless offspring,
Jesus had special regard in it to <i>the dispositions found in
children</i>;&mdash;for by reason of infantile weakness
corruption is then unable to manifest itself, and all appears to
be gentleness and loveliness;&mdash;pride and malice and such
like evils being necessarily absent, and humility and lowliness
and dependance and such like tempers being <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>by the same
necessity present.&nbsp; So that it was with regard to
<i>these</i>, rather than to <i>the subjects of them</i>, that
Jesus said, &ldquo;Of such is the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This view harmonizes exactly with what He said in immediate
connection with the words we are considering: &ldquo;Verily, I
say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as
<i>a little child</i>, he shall not enter therein.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The great object of the Lord evidently was, to set forth
children, both as to what is <i>not</i> seen in them, and what
<i>is</i> found in their meek, passive, harmless, submissive, and
dependant state, as the pattern for His disciples&rsquo;
imitation;&mdash;as, in fact, the exhibition of what must be
found in every one, who would be a real subject of His
kingdom.&nbsp; And that it was of <i>the age of infancy or
childhood</i>, and not of the persons of the children themselves,
that Christ was here speaking, is confirmed by a reference to the
circumstance already mentioned, which is related by St. Matthew,
in the beginning of the eighteenth Chapter, and which had
occurred not long before the bringing of the children to
Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The disciples came unto Jesus, saying, Who is
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?&nbsp; And Jesus called a
little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of them, and
said, Verily, I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
as <i>little children</i>, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of
heaven.&nbsp; Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this
little child,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, so as to be as this little
child is,&mdash;&ldquo;the same is greatest in the kingdom of
heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it cannot be <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>supposed, that this child was
selected by Christ as having any peculiar excellency in
him.&nbsp; <i>Any child</i> would doubtless have served His
purpose:&mdash;the child of a Gentile as well as of a Jew.&nbsp;
Neither <i>the nature</i> of the child, nor <i>the state of the
child&rsquo;s soul in the sight of God</i>, had any thing to do
with the use which the Lord here makes of him.&nbsp; It was
<i>the state of childhood</i> that Christ evidently had respect
unto, and this He makes the model of His disciples.&nbsp; Just as
David had said,&mdash;&ldquo;My soul is even as <i>a weaned
child</i>;&rdquo; and as St. Paul afterwards wrote to the
Corinthians,&mdash;&ldquo;In malice be ye
<i>children</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if farther evidence that this
was Christ&rsquo;s meaning be needed, it is found in the
transition which He, as it were, insensibly makes from the
&ldquo;little children&rdquo; to &ldquo;believers in Him;&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>those little ones</i>,&rdquo; (the word used by Him
being changed,) &ldquo;<i>those little ones</i>,&rdquo; He calls
them, &ldquo;<i>which believe in me</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;evidently
referring to such as regard themselves to be the meanest and most
humble of His disciples.&nbsp; With respect to children
themselves, personally considered, the words of Christ seem only
to convey a general expression of good will toward them,&mdash;to
be understood and applied in conformity with other declarations
of the Inspired Word.&nbsp; As to the bearing of this whole
passage upon <i>baptism</i>, it is impossible to prove by it the
connection of the new birth with baptism, or indeed anything
about baptism at all;&mdash;except that it affords great
encouragement to godly parents to bring their children to this
Ordinance, and in it to present and dedicate <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>them to the
Lord their God.&nbsp; If we attempt to force the application of
the passage, it may be turned against ourselves, and used as an
argument for doing without the baptism of children altogether:
for Christ does not say anything about the baptism of the
children brought to Him, although baptism was then in use among
His disciples.&nbsp; His silence respecting it is no valid
argument against it; but it prevents the possibility of proving
anything <i>absolutely</i> as to the effect of baptism from this
occurrence.&nbsp; In truth, the circumstances of the cases must
be analogous, before <i>any</i> application can fairly be made of
it.&nbsp; Children must not be brought in gross ignorance and
utter carelessness to be baptized, that they may receive their
name from a minister, or for some other merely temporal object,
without any regard to Christ or His grace, and this be said to
correspond with what was done for the children in the history
before us.&nbsp; This is to profane Christ&rsquo;s Sacrament; and
shall the profanation of it be attended with a blessing?&nbsp; No
wonder that baptized children show no benefit from their baptism,
when it has really not been a bringing of them to Christ at
all:&mdash;Christ having never been thought of from first to
last.&nbsp; If an appeal be made to the supposed efficacy of
<i>the Ordinance itself</i>, then this passage has nothing to do
with the subject.&nbsp; Other Scriptures must be resorted to,
wherein reference <i>is</i> made to baptism.&nbsp; From what was
done and said on this occasion, believing parents, anxious for
the salvation of their children, may draw <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>much
encouragement to bring them to Christ in baptism, and to pray and
hope for a blessing, in connection with the subsequent use of
means for their spiritual good: and they who act thus, comply
much more with His mind and spirit, than those who withhold their
children from the Ordinance.&nbsp; But no absolute and
unconditional benefit in baptism can by any fair process of
reasoning be deduced from it.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We proceed, then, to examine the passages in &lsquo;The Acts
of the Apostles,&rsquo; which relate to the subject of Baptism;
and we shall there see the directions which Christ gave them
concerning it carried into effect.</p>
<p>No sooner had the Apostles begun to execute their important
Commission by preaching the gospel on the day of Pentecost, than
God gave testimony to their word by convincing many of sin,
especially of the sin of &ldquo;crucifying the Lord of
glory;&rdquo; and they &ldquo;said unto Peter and to the rest of
the Apostles,&rdquo; (as we read in Acts ii. 37,) &ldquo;Men and
brethren, what shall we do?&rdquo;&nbsp; To this Peter answered,
&ldquo;Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
gift of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; For the promise is unto you and to
your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the
Lord our God shall call.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this exhortation, the
principle enjoined by Christ upon the <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Apostles is found.&nbsp; Repentance
and faith are first required.&nbsp; For the expressions,
&ldquo;Be baptized <i>in the name of Jesus Christ</i>,&rdquo; do
certainly mean, &ldquo;Make an open profession of your believing
in Jesus Christ, by being baptized in His name.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
this is their meaning there can be no doubt, when we consider
what is said immediately afterwards: (v. 41.) &ldquo;Then <i>they
that gladly received his word</i>&rdquo; (and how is the word
received but by faith?&nbsp; See 1 Thess. ii. 13,) &ldquo;were
baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three
thousand souls.&nbsp; And they continued stedfastly in the
Apostles&rsquo; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread
and in prayers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, then, things were as Christ
intended them to be.&nbsp; They who were convinced of sin ask
what they shall do&mdash;that is, to be saved.&nbsp; They are
told to repent, and openly to confess Christ&mdash;that is, that
they believed in Him as the Saviour&mdash;by being
baptized.&nbsp; And they are assured, that upon doing <i>these
things</i>&mdash;(the whole exhortation being taken together)
they should receive &ldquo;remission of their sins&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the gift of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; They gladly
received the word preached to them; and they were then baptized;
and while their baptism was a public profession of repentance and
faith on their part, it would doubtless be a means of grace to
them, and a seal and pledge on God&rsquo;s part of the
forgiveness of their sins and of His good-will and favour towards
them.&nbsp; And this was the right and legitimate use of the
Ordinance.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>The
next instance recorded in The Acts of the Apostles is that of the
people of Samaria, to whom Philip went and preached Christ,
(viii. 5.)&nbsp; They had for a long time been bewitched with the
sorceries of a certain man, called Simon; but, it is added,
&ldquo;when they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning
the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were
baptized, both men and women.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same order is seen
here, as at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.&nbsp; They first
<i>believe</i>, and then <i>are baptized</i>.&nbsp; But now a
very different case presents itself to us.&nbsp; Simon, the
sorcerer himself, is said also to have believed and been
baptized, and to have &ldquo;continued with Philip,&rdquo;
(having of course ceased from his sorceries) &ldquo;and wondered,
beholding the miracles and signs which were done&rdquo; by
him.&nbsp; Some think, that by pretending to be Philip&rsquo;s
disciple Simon hoped to be able to do the same; for that his
opinion of Philip was, that he was but a more skilful sorcerer
than himself.&nbsp; It appears that the Holy Ghost&mdash;by which
the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, the ability to speak
divers languages and such like, are undoubtedly meant,&mdash;had
not fallen upon any of the people of Samaria at their baptism,
but was reserved to be bestowed in answer to the prayers of the
Apostles and by the imposition of their hands.&nbsp; For
&ldquo;when the Apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
who, when they were come down, prayed for them that they might
receive <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>the Holy Ghost: then laid they their hands on them, and
they received the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; (v. 14, 15.)&nbsp; The
effect of this gift must have been immediately perceptible by
others; for it led to that bold and blasphemous offer of money by
Simon to the Apostles, which betrayed the hypocrisy, and pride,
and wickedness of his heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;When Simon saw, that
through laying on of the Apostles&rsquo; hands the Holy Ghost was
given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this power,
that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo; (v. 18, 19.)&nbsp; Peter&rsquo;s indignant reply to
him proves, that, though he had been baptized, he was in heart a
sorcerer still.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dog had turned to his own vomit
again; and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the
mire.&rdquo; (2 Peter ii. 22.)&nbsp; No change whatever had taken
place in his character.&nbsp; And no change seems to have taken
place in him afterwards; if we may judge from what he said to the
Apostles.&nbsp; For when Peter denounced the just judgment of God
against him, and declared that he &ldquo;had neither part nor lot
in the matter,&rdquo; there was no sign of real penitence in his
expressions.&nbsp; He deprecated the judgment indeed, and asked
the Apostles to pray for him that it might not come upon
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these
things which ye have spoken come upon me.&rdquo; (v, 24.)&nbsp;
But even Pharaoh went farther than this.&nbsp; He said to Moses
and Aaron, &ldquo;Intreat the Lord, that He may take away this
death from me;&rdquo; but he also added, &ldquo;I have <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>sinned:&rdquo; &ldquo;I am wicked:&rdquo;&mdash;a
confession, which Simon never made; for it is to be feared that
the conviction of it he never felt.&nbsp; And his case
incontestably proves, that professions and Ordinances avail
nothing, unless the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; be also &ldquo;right in
the sight of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this same Chapter we have an account of the baptism of the
Ethiopian Eunuch.&nbsp; As far as his knowledge reached, this
interesting person was a sincere and devout worshipper of the
true God: but, as in the case of Cornelius afterwards, it was
necessary that he should be brought to the clear and full
knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Philip therefore
is sent to instruct him, and is gladly received by him as his
teacher.&nbsp; Philip, taking as his text the place of Scripture
which he found the Eunuch reading, &ldquo;preached unto him
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; And his word was mixed with faith in him that
heard it.&nbsp; And coming to a certain water, the Eunuch, having
learned what was the rite of initiation which Christ had
appointed, was anxious to take this opportunity of being openly
received into the number of His disciples; and he therefore asked
Philip, &ldquo;What doth hinder me to be baptized?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our Authorized Version has a reply from Philip and a confession
of faith by the Eunuch, which are not found in many very ancient
Manuscripts.&nbsp; Beza says of this verse, &ldquo;God forbid I
should think it ought to be expunged, since it contains such a
confession of faith, as was in the Apostolic ages required of
adults, in order to their being admitted to baptism.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But
whether it be genuine or not, is of no material
consequence.&nbsp; Christ had confined baptism to believers, in
His instructions to His Apostles; and this verse only repeats the
limitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;If thou believest with all thine heart,
thou mayst&rdquo; be baptized.&nbsp; And as for the confession of
faith attributed to the Eunuch, it is plain that he was prepared
and willing to make it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both he and Philip then went down
into the water, and Philip baptized him.&nbsp; In what manner, we
are not told; nor do even the expressions, &ldquo;into the
water,&rdquo; decide whether it was by immersion or the pouring
or sprinkling of some of the water on his person.&nbsp; If the
mode of administration had been essential to the validity of the
Sacrament, no doubt it would have been mentioned.&nbsp; But
neither here nor any where else is this the case.&nbsp; The
Eunuch, then, having thus received the grace of the Covenant and
the seal of the Covenant, confirmed too by the sign of
Philip&rsquo;s miraculous removal from him,&mdash;&ldquo;went on
his way rejoicing.&rdquo; (v. 39.)</p>
<p>In the next Chapter, the ninth, we have an account of the
conversion and baptism of Saul of Tarsus.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus
appeared to him as he went to Damascus to persecute the disciples
which might be found there: and Saul, having fallen to the ground
and being told that that same Jesus whom he persecuted stood
before him, exclaimed with all humility and entire submission,
&ldquo;Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; One of
the most astonishing <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>instances of a sudden change of mind
on record!&nbsp; The Lord then bade Saul &ldquo;arise&rdquo; from
the earth, in order that he might hear what more He had to say to
him.&nbsp; And well might Saul be overwhelmed by the
communication which the Lord Jesus proceeds to make to him!&nbsp;
In the account given in this ninth Chapter, it is briefly stated
that the Lord commanded him to &ldquo;go into the city,&rdquo;
(Damascus) and that &ldquo;it should be told him what he must
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; This no doubt was a part of His
communication.&nbsp; But by a reference to the account of this
transaction given by himself before Agrippa, as recorded in the
xxvith Chapter of this Book, it appears that the Lord made known
to Saul <i>at that very time</i> much of His mind and will
concerning him; and that He said to him, &ldquo;I have appeared
unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a Minister and a Witness
both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in
the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the
people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open
their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light and from the
power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of
sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith
that is in me.&rdquo; (v. 16&ndash;18)&nbsp; After this, Saul
went into Damascus, and was three days without sight or
food.&nbsp; Ananias was then sent to him by the Lord Jesus; and
having put his hands upon him that he might receive his sight,
and having repeated to him the Commission which Jesus had in
person given to <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>him, said, (as we read in the account of this event
given in the xxiind Chapter,) &ldquo;And now why tarriest
thou?&nbsp; Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
calling on the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
&ldquo;arose, and was baptized.&rdquo;&nbsp; This address of
Ananias to Saul, taken by itself, would seem to connect the
forgiveness or putting away of sin with the act of baptism.&nbsp;
But were not Saul&rsquo;s sins forgiven before his baptism?&nbsp;
And did he not know that they were forgiven?&nbsp; Suppose a
subject to have a very mistaken view of his Sovereign&rsquo;s
title to the crown, and an ignorant but very fervid zeal for some
other.&nbsp; Suppose him not to have taken due pains to correct
his error, and to be at the same time under the influence of much
high-mindedness and self-confidence.&nbsp; He takes up arms
against his Prince, and for a season is very successful in his
efforts.&nbsp; But suddenly he finds himself in his
power:&mdash;and at the same time his eyes are opened;&mdash;and
he is convinced of the mistake which he had made, and of the
delusion under which he had been acting.&nbsp; He now casts
himself at his Sovereign&rsquo;s feet, and professes his
willingness to be at his absolute disposal for the future.&nbsp;
Suppose the generous Monarch to reply;&mdash;&lsquo;I know that
thou wast engaged in a blind and unequal contest with me:
(&ldquo;it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks:&rdquo;)
but I am come to tell thee, that I have appointed thee my
Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, and am about to
send thee forth to a distant kingdom, there to transact for me
some difficult and important business, <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>in which my honour and interest and
the interest of my subjects are greatly concerned: (&ldquo;For I
have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a Minister
and a Witness of these things which thou hast seen:&rdquo;) I
will from time to time communicate most confidentially with thee:
(&ldquo;and of those things in the which I will appear unto
thee:&rdquo;) all my authority and power shall be put forth for
thy personal preservation: (&ldquo;delivering thee from the
people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee:&rdquo;)
and nothing shall be wanting on my part to make thine Ambassage
successful.&rsquo; (&ldquo;to open their eyes, and to turn them
from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God,
&amp;c.&rdquo;)&nbsp; Would this subject, after such a
communication and commission,&mdash;delivered too by his Prince
in person&mdash;have any doubt on his mind respecting the pardon
of his rebellion?&nbsp; He might for a few days retire into
secret, to reflect on his case;&mdash;to consider the evil of his
own conduct, and the noble and generous manner in which he had
been treated, when he might justly have been dealt with in a very
different way.&nbsp; But his preferment of necessity involved his
pardon and his full and complete establishment in his
Sovereign&rsquo;s favour.&nbsp; How could he, in the very nature
of things, execute the Commission given to him, if he were to be
put to death for his treason?&nbsp; Nevertheless, it might be
very expedient, that a public manifestation should be made to the
kingdom of this change in the state of things: for the
Prince&rsquo;s visit to his <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>subject was in secret, though not the
least suspicion could attach to the truth and sincerity of
it.&nbsp; A public Ceremony might, therefore, take place, at
which his own change of mind and his Sovereign&rsquo;s pardon
might be proclaimed, and his sealed Commission delivered into his
hands:&mdash;but this, however important, would follow the
previous interview as a matter of course.&nbsp; What has thus
been <i>supposed</i> was more than fulfilled in the case of Saul
of Tarsus: for no communication among men could equal the
condescension and grace of the Lord Jesus towards him and the
confidence which He reposed in him.&nbsp; And the manner in which
Ananias spake to Saul of his baptism seems to convey the
last-mentioned idea; namely, that, however necessary, it was to
take place as a matter of course.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>And now why
tarriest thou</i>?&nbsp; <i>Arise</i>, <i>and be baptized</i>,
<i>and wash away thy sins</i>, <i>calling on the name of the
Lord</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This washing away of his sins in baptism
was a mystical or emblematical washing.&nbsp; It was a public
manifestation of his penitence and his pardon.&nbsp; It was on
his part an open avowal of submission to Christ; and on the part
of the Lord Jesus Christ it was an equally open avowal of the
acceptance of his submission, and a seal of his sonship and
security.&nbsp; Hereby his faith would be confirmed, and his
grace increased by virtue of &ldquo;calling on the name of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how could this confirmation and increase
take place, unless faith and grace had been possessed by him
previously?</p>
<p>The baptism of Cornelius and his company, recorded <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>in Chapter
x., is the next instance we meet with in Scripture of the
administration of this Sacrament of the Christian Church.&nbsp;
This case is remarkable as being the first-fruits of the Gentiles
unto Christ.&nbsp; Peter&mdash;to whom Christ had given
&ldquo;the keys of the kingdom of Heaven,&rdquo; (Matt. xvi. 19,)
that is, the high privilege of opening the door of faith both to
the Jews and to the Gentiles,&mdash;was sent by God to preach the
gospel to this Roman Centurion.&nbsp; His objections, as a Jew,
to go unto one of another nation having been removed by a vision,
Peter went to the house of Cornelius, where he found him and his
kinsmen and near friends assembled together to receive and to
hear him.&nbsp; He faithfully preached Christ unto them: and
while he spake those important words, &ldquo;To Him give all the
prophets witness, that, through His name, whosoever believeth in
Him shall receive remission of sins,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Holy Ghost
fell on all them which heard the word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under the
influence of the Spirit they &ldquo;spake with tongues, and
magnified God.&nbsp; Then answered Peter, Can any man forbid
water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the
Holy Ghost as well as we?&nbsp; And he commanded them to be
baptized in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;
(43&ndash;47.)&nbsp; In the case of the people of Samaria, the
Holy Ghost was not given when they were baptized, but <i>some
time after</i>;&mdash;when the Apostles Peter and John, came down
from Jerusalem and laid their hands upon them.&nbsp; In the case
of Cornelius and his friends, the same Holy Spirit was given <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>before their
baptism, and while Peter was preaching the gospel to them.&nbsp;
Thus it was not always <i>at</i> the administration of the
Ordinance that the Holy Ghost was given.&nbsp; And though the
immediate effect of this gift of the Spirit was manifested in the
power to speak with tongues and to prophesy, yet it also enabled
and disposed them to &ldquo;magnify God:&rdquo; thereby showing,
that His ordinary sanctifying operations were included.&nbsp;
Well then might Cornelius and they who were with him receive the
outward and visible sign of baptism by water, since they had
already received the thing signified by it!</p>
<p>In Chapter xvi., two very interesting cases are recorded,
which are worthy of particular attention.&nbsp; They occurred at
Philippi, in Macedonia; to which country St. Paul and his company
had been called by a vision to preach the gospel there.&nbsp; The
first of these is the case of a woman named Lydia.&nbsp; In the
13th and 14th verses the sacred historian writes; &ldquo;And on
the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer
was wont to be made; and we spake unto the women which resorted
thither.&nbsp; And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of
purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us:
whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things
which were spoken of Paul.&rdquo;&nbsp; In consequence of the
opening of her heart by the Lord, she heard to her soul&rsquo;s
profit.&nbsp; She received the gospel which Paul preached.&nbsp;
We are then told concerning her, that &ldquo;she was baptized,
and her household.&rdquo;&nbsp; And her <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>faith brought
forth fruit: for she immediately invited the Apostle and those
who were with him, to come and abide at her house; and she would
not take a denial.&nbsp; They therefore abode with her many
days.&nbsp; Another case then occurred, which served to show why
they had been called to preach the gospel in Macedonia.&nbsp;
Paul and Silas having been thrown into prison for casting a
spirit of divination out of a certain damsel, the Lord sent a
great earthquake at midnight, which opened the doors of the
prison, and awoke the jailor; who, fearing that the prisoners had
fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself; when Paul
assured him that they were all there.&nbsp; Upon this, &ldquo;he
sprang in, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and said, Sirs,
what must I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul and Silas
immediately preached the gospel to him, saying, &ldquo;Believe on
the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then at greater length &ldquo;spake unto
him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same success attended the word, as in the
case of Lydia.&nbsp; And his faith, like her&rsquo;s, wrought by
love; for he immediately began to show all the attention in his
power to Paul and Silas.&nbsp; And as Lydia was baptized, and her
household, so it is said that the jailor &ldquo;was baptized, he
and all his, straightway.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it is evident, that in
the baptizing of the two principal persons in this history, Lydia
and the jailor, the same course was pursued by the Apostle as in
all the other instances which have been considered.&nbsp; They
first believed in the <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>Lord Jesus Christ, and then they were
baptized.&nbsp; But a new feature presents itself on both these
occasions; that is, the baptizing of their households.&nbsp; And
hence has been drawn a very common argument in favour of the
baptizing of children; as it has been thought <i>probable</i>
that children formed a part of these households.&nbsp; Beside
these cases, there are only two other, in which the house or
family is spoken of in the New Testament in connection with the
head of the house,&mdash;the house of Crispus and the house of
Stephanas; and though it is taking them out of their order, it
may be well to notice them also here.&nbsp; Let us consider first
the case of the jailor.&nbsp; It is said that &ldquo;he was
baptized, and all his,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;all his
house;&rdquo; to whom, as well as to himself, Paul and Silas had
&ldquo;spoken the word of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if we are
told that <i>they were baptized</i>, we are also told that
<i>they believed</i>.&nbsp; In the 34th verse we read, that the
jailor &ldquo;rejoiced, believing in God with all his
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to force this case to support
Infant-baptism, an attempt is sometimes made to change the
construction of the sentence, <i>thus</i>; &ldquo;He, believing
in God, rejoiced with all his house.&rdquo;&nbsp; This makes very
little difference in the meaning.&nbsp; For if his house were
capable of rejoicing with him, they must have been of a
sufficient age to understand <i>why</i> they rejoiced: and as his
faith in Christ was the cause of <i>his</i> joy, it must have
been also the cause of <i>theirs</i>; and if they could rejoice
in <i>his</i> faith, why might they not have had faith <i>of
their own</i> <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>to rejoice in?&nbsp; But the Greek will not admit of the
above construction.&nbsp; The adverb translated &ldquo;with all
his house&rdquo; must be referred to the participle
&ldquo;believing,&rdquo; which in the Original follows it; and
these words express the reason of his joy, which was, his own
faith and the faith of his family.&nbsp; Beza gives <i>this</i>
as the sense of the latter part of the 34th verse;
&ldquo;He,&rdquo; that is, the jailor, &ldquo;rejoiced because
that with the whole of his house he had believed in God.&rdquo;
<a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; <i>As believers</i>,
therefore,&mdash;of whomsoever his &ldquo;house&rdquo;
consisted&mdash;they were entitled to baptism <i>on their own
account</i>, and thus they stood precisely in the same situation
with himself.&nbsp; And <i>no inference</i> can <i>hence</i> be
drawn respecting Infant-baptism.&nbsp; Of Crispus, the chief
ruler of the Synagogue at Corinth, mentioned in the xviiith
Chapter, it is at once said that he &ldquo;believed on the Lord
with all his house;&rdquo; and though their baptism is not
particularly spoken of, it would of course take place with the
baptism of the other believing Corinthians.&nbsp; From St.
Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle to the Corinthians we learn that he
himself baptized Crispus;&mdash;no mention being made of his
household: but as we are informed that they were
<i>believers</i>, they would certainly be baptized, like the
household of the Philippian jailor.&nbsp; This case, therefore,
does not apply to the subject of Infant-baptism.&nbsp; Neither
does the baptizing of the house of Stephanas.&nbsp; St. Paul
tells the Corinthians, in the beginning of his First Epistle,
that he baptized this house: but what <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>does he say of them at the close of
the Epistle?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye know,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the
house of Stephanas, that it is <i>the first fruits of Achaia</i>,
<i>and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the
saints</i>:&rdquo; (xvi. 15.)&mdash;a description this, of
<i>personal religion</i>; and proving that they were <i>all</i>
capable of meeting the requirements of baptism <i>in their own
persons</i>.&nbsp; The only remaining case in which a household
is said to have been baptized, is that of Lydia at
Philippi.&nbsp; Now it seems evident from her history that she
had no husband.&nbsp; The house is twice called <i>her house</i>;
and <i>the household</i> is called <i>hers</i> also.&nbsp; And
the invitation to Paul and his company is given <i>by herself and
in her own name</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come into <i>my house</i>, and
abide there.&rdquo; (v. 15.)&nbsp; This language could never have
been used of her and by her, if she had had a husband.&nbsp; Nor
does it appear at all likely, that she was a widow with children;
for, from the particularity with which her circumstances are
related, there is every probability that, had this been the case,
some intimation would have been given of it.&nbsp; We have not
only <i>her name</i> mentioned, but <i>the place</i> she came
from or still belonged to, and <i>the business</i> which she
followed: but no allusion whatever to any family.&nbsp; She could
not have been a person in a low condition of life, or she would
not have been able to receive and entertain in her house for many
days the Apostle and those who were with him.&nbsp; She would
therefore have &ldquo;household servants,&rdquo; and probably
persons to assist her in her business as &ldquo;a seller of
purple.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the whole <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>tenor of her history is against the
supposition, that there were in her house <i>any who could not
answer for themselves</i>.&nbsp; It appears, then, from the
consideration of the cases in which the baptizing of households
is mentioned in Scripture, that no argument whatever can be
deduced from them on the subject of Infant-baptism.&nbsp; A
reference to them, therefore, only gives an advantage to the
opponents of the practice:&mdash;an argument which will not bear
close examination being always worse than none.</p>
<p>The xviiith Chapter of this Book of The Acts of the Apostles
contains the account of Crispus and his house just referred
to.&nbsp; It is also simply, though very strikingly, said of many
others of the Corinthians, that they
&ldquo;heard,&rdquo;&mdash;they &ldquo;believed,&rdquo;&mdash;and
they &ldquo;were baptized.&rdquo; (v. 8.)&nbsp; Faith came by
hearing; and baptism, according to the institution of Christ,
followed faith.</p>
<p>There only remains, in this Book of The Acts of the Apostles,
another instance of baptism to be noticed; and this occurred at
Ephesus.&nbsp; It is related in the beginning of the nineteenth
Chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Paul came to Ephesus, and finding certain
disciples, he said unto them, have ye received the Holy Ghost
since ye believed?&nbsp; And they said unto him, We have not so
much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
are reminded here of that passage in the Seventh Chapter of St.
John, (v. 39.) where the Evangelist, referring to some words of
the Lord Jesus, says, &ldquo;This spake He of the Spirit, which
they that believe on Him should&rdquo;&mdash;that is, <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;receive;&rdquo;&mdash;adding,
&ldquo;for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus
was not yet glorified.&rdquo;&nbsp; The literal translation of
the latter part of this text is, &ldquo;for the Holy Ghost was
not yet:&rdquo;&mdash;from which it would appear, that at that
time there was no Holy Ghost; and therefore that the ignorance of
His existence, of which the disciples at Ephesus seem to speak,
was not so much to be wondered at.&nbsp; But the solution of the
difficulty is probably the same in both cases.&nbsp; When St.
John says, &ldquo;For the Holy Ghost was not yet, because that
Jesus was not yet glorified,&rdquo; his meaning is made plain by
the very proper introduction into our translation of the word
&ldquo;given;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;for the Holy Ghost was not yet
given.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evidently refers to the extraordinary
and abundant pouring out of the Holy Spirit, which was reserved
until Jesus had ascended up on high, and (according to the
prophecy in the lxviiith Psalm) had &ldquo;received gifts for
men;&rdquo; and when He received them, He shed them forth, first
upon His Apostles on the day of Pentecost, and afterwards upon
multitudes of believers, generally by the laying on of their
hands.&nbsp; But the disciples at Ephesus had not heard of these
things.&nbsp; They had had no communication with any Christian
Church or people; and thus, though they had been baptized with
the baptism of John, as they tell the Apostle Paul in answer to
his next question, &ldquo;Unto what then were ye
baptized?&rdquo;&mdash;and <i>must</i> therefore have heard of
the existence of the Holy Ghost, yet they had not heard of His
having been given; and <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>they express their ignorance in
language very like to that which the Evangelist uses, when he is
describing the period before the gift of the Spirit on the day of
Pentecost.&nbsp; This seems a reasonable account of the
matter.&nbsp; And if the same course had been pursued in the
translation of both texts, the likeness between them would have
been very evident.&nbsp; In the passage in St. John the
explanatory word &ldquo;given&rdquo; is introduced.&nbsp; In the
Chapter before us, not only is this or any such word omitted, but
the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; is added,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>any</i> Holy
Ghost,&rdquo; without a word in the Original to justify it.&nbsp;
The literal rendering would be; &ldquo;We have not even heard
whether the Holy Ghost is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now if the word
&ldquo;given,&rdquo; or &ldquo;come,&rdquo; were added, as in St.
John, the two passages would exactly correspond:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Holy Ghost was not yet given:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We have not
even heard whether the Holy Ghost is given.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
persons had probably not been long at Ephesus, but might have
been (as Dr. Whitby suggests) &ldquo;travelling into other parts
of the world, where the gospel had not yet been
planted.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a question has arisen, whether what is
said in the fifth verse relates to <i>them</i>, or whether it is
not a continuation of St. Paul&rsquo;s description of
John&rsquo;s baptism, begun in the verse before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of
the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The objection to the application of
this to the twelve disciples found at Ephesus is, that it
involves a repetition of the Ordinance of baptism.&nbsp; But
though John&rsquo;s baptism and the Christian Sacrament were
administered <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span><i>substantially</i> upon the same principles, there was
a sufficient difference between them to warrant the baptizing
again, in the name of the Sacred Trinity, of those who might
already have partaken of John&rsquo;s baptism.&nbsp; The baptism
of John was connected with an intermediate, or, at most, an
introductory dispensation.&nbsp; It was, what the Apostle says of
the tabernacle,&mdash;&ldquo;for the time then
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after that Christ had appointed baptism
&ldquo;in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost,&rdquo; as the door of entrance into His Church for
believers, there was no reason why such as had been baptized with
John&rsquo;s baptism should not be admitted to Christ&rsquo;s
Ordinance also, if occasion seemed to require it.&nbsp; And
indeed St. Paul&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;Unto what then were ye
baptized?&rdquo; seems to recognize a distinction of
baptisms.&nbsp; But no argument whatever can be founded upon this
case for the repetition of baptism <i>under the same
Dispensation</i>.&nbsp; To suppose that the words in the 5th
verse are a continuation of St. Paul&rsquo;s description of
John&rsquo;s baptism, would be inconsistent with the natural
course of the narrative; and to say that John &ldquo;baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus,&rdquo; would be to speak of his
baptism as it is no where else spoken of.&nbsp; Beside, the
persons on whom St. Paul laid his hands, as stated in the 6th
verse, were the disciples found at Ephesus, and not the people in
general who were baptized by John.&nbsp; So that it appears that
what is said in the 5th verse relates to these disciples.&nbsp;
Their knowledge was very limited; but they had the <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>characteristic dispositions of disciples,&mdash;humility
and teachableness; and thus, when they were farther instructed by
St. Paul in the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, they, no
doubt with the greatest willingness, were baptized in His
name.&nbsp; And then as in the case of Samaria, &ldquo;when the
Apostle had laid his hands upon them,&rdquo; (but not before,)
&ldquo;the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues
and prophesied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is all that is said on the subject of baptism, as a
Sacrament of the Christian Church, in the Scripture-history of
The Acts of the Apostles.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">We come, then, to The Epistles.</p>
<p>The first passage we meet with on our subject is in the sixth
Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.&nbsp; St. Paul, the writer
of this Epistle, had been dwelling, in the former Chapters, upon
the great gospel-doctrine of salvation by grace through
faith.&nbsp; He had declared, that &ldquo;a man is justified by
faith without the deeds of the law;&rdquo; (iii. 28,) that in
this way Abraham was justified; (iv. 3,) and that in this way
every one else must be justified: (iv. 24,) and in the latter
part of the fifth Chapter he had spoken strongly of God&rsquo;s
grace much more abounding where man&rsquo;s sin abounded.&nbsp;
The Apostle, then in the beginning of the sixth Chapter
anticipates an abuse which might be made of this doctrine, and
corrects it.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall we say then?&nbsp; Shall we
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>continue
in sin,&rdquo; in order &ldquo;that grace may abound?&nbsp; God
forbid!&rdquo;&nbsp; Abhorred be the thought!&nbsp; And he
proceeds to reason upon this; and to show, not only its
<i>incongruity</i>, but (in a sense which other Scriptures allow)
its <i>impossibility</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;How shall <i>we</i> that
<i>are dead</i> to sin, <i>live</i> any longer
therein?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he brings in the subject of their
baptism.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know ye not, that so many of us as were
baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into His death?&nbsp;
Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death; that like
as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father,
even so we also should walk in newness of life.&rdquo; (v. 3,
4.)&nbsp; After what we have seen already of baptism, as
administered by the Apostles and others, we can be at no loss to
perceive the meaning of St. Paul&rsquo;s expression,
&ldquo;baptized into Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to His own
command, all who believed in Him were baptized; and this act or
Ordinance was their open avowal of faith in Him,&mdash;their
public and palpable engrafting and incorporation into Him and His
Church,&mdash;and their solemn dedication and consecration to the
love, worship, and service of God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost. <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; Their baptism into Christ,
consequent upon, and declarative of, their faith in Him, publicly
and manifestly bound them unto Him;&mdash;to strict and spiritual
conformity with Him.&nbsp; And thus the Apostle goes on to remind
those who had been &ldquo;baptized into Christ,&rdquo;&mdash;for
the Epistle was addressed to those at Rome <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>who were
&ldquo;beloved of God and called to be saints,&rdquo; and whose
&ldquo;faith was spoken of throughout the whole world,&rdquo; (i.
7, 8,)&mdash;that they were &ldquo;baptized into His
death;&rdquo; that is, into conformity to His death; that in
virtue of His dying for their sins, and after the pattern of this
His death, and by motives and considerations drawn from His
death, they should die to all sin and be delivered from the
reigning power of it.&nbsp; &lsquo;The faithful,&rsquo; observes
Beza on this expression, &lsquo;are said to be baptized into the
death of Christ, that through His death sin may die and be
abolished in them.&rsquo;&nbsp; And to carry this conformity
still farther, St. Paul adds, &ldquo;Therefore we are buried with
Him by baptism into death.&rdquo;&nbsp; For as Christ&rsquo;s
burial was a manifestation of the reality of His death, so ought
it to be also with them respecting sin.&nbsp; It was likewise an
introduction to, and preparation for, His glorious
resurrection.&nbsp; And thus the Apostle proceeds with his
exhortation;&mdash;&ldquo;that like as Christ was raised from the
dead by the glory (the glorious power) of the Father, even so we
also (we who are baptized into Him) should walk in newness of
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the following verses&mdash;indeed to
the end of the Chapter&mdash;St. Paul presses the Roman
Christians to devotedness to God&rsquo;s service, in language the
most forcible which could have been made use of.&nbsp; Here then
we see what baptism is, in the case of real believers: and it is
of such alone that the Apostle here speaks.&nbsp; The obligations
which result from it to righteousness and holiness are of the
strongest possible description.&nbsp; <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>And these obligations have their
influence upon the faithful; though that influence is capable of
a continued increase.&nbsp; How different is this from a service
which is &ldquo;outward&rdquo; only &ldquo;in the
flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expressions, &ldquo;buried with Christ by baptism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;walking in newness of life&rdquo; &ldquo;after the
pattern of His resurrection,&rdquo; seem to imply, that the
method of baptizing was by immersion, or plunging the whole body
under water, from which it would come forth as by a kind of
resurrection.&nbsp; That baptism <i>has been</i> thus
administered, and <i>may be</i> thus administered, is freely
admitted.&nbsp; But this is <i>no proof</i> that such was the
unvarying method, and certainly <i>no precept</i> that it shall
always be administered in this way.&nbsp; It may, however, with
much reason be argued, that the expressions, &ldquo;baptized into
His death,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;buried with Him,&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;walking in newness of life&rdquo; like unto His
resurrection,&mdash;were not used by the Apostle with any
reference to <i>the mode of administration</i>, but to <i>the
events spoken of</i>; namely, Christ&rsquo;s death, burial, and
resurrection.&nbsp; Christians are said to have been
&ldquo;circumcised in Christ,&rdquo; and to be &ldquo;crucified
with Him,&rdquo; without any outward corresponding actions.&nbsp;
But if an argument for <i>immersion</i> may be drawn from this
passage, an argument for <i>affusion</i>, or the pouring of water
upon the person, may with greater force be drawn from the manner
in which the Holy Ghost descended upon Christ Himself at His
baptism, and upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost, <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>and
subsequently upon others who were baptized, and from the language
used to describe it.&nbsp; When Peter preached to Cornelius, it
is said, &ldquo;The Holy Ghost <i>fell on</i> all them that heard
the word:&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;On the Gentiles also <i>was
poured out</i> the gift of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
expressly called by St. Peter, their being &ldquo;baptized with
the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; (Acts xi. 15, 16.)&nbsp; An argument might
also be drawn for the practice of <i>sprinkling</i>, not only
from the striking similarity between baptism and the water of
separation which was to be sprinkled upon the unclean, (Numb.
xix. 19.,) but from the connection between the water of baptism
and the blood of Christ, of which, as well as of the Holy Spirit,
this water is an emblem, and which is called &ldquo;the blood of
sprinkling&rdquo; from the method of its application to the
heart.&nbsp; From all these things, and from the absence of any
specific directions on the subject, it is reasonable to conclude,
that baptism may be rightly administered in each of the
<i>three</i> ways which have been mentioned.&nbsp; And it is too
much like an undue magnifying of <i>the sign</i>, when it is
attempted to make it in all respects answerable to the thing
signified by it.</p>
<p>This is the only passage <i>directly</i> relating to baptism
in the Epistle to the Romans.</p>
<p>But there is a statement of the Apostle in the eleventh
Chapter, which not only confirms what has been already said of
the continuance of the Covenant with Abraham under the Christian
Dispensation, but which also bears strongly upon the <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>subject of
the right of the children of believing parents to the token of
the Covenant, together with their parents.&nbsp; The passage
particularly referred to is the 24th verse of the eleventh
Chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if thou wert cut out of the olive-tree
which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into
a good olive-tree, how much more shall these, which be the
natural branches, be grafted into <i>their own
olive-tree</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; The Apostle is here comparing the
admission of the Gentiles into the Church of God, to the cutting
off of branches from a wild olive and the grafting of them into a
good olive; the good olive being the ancient church, planted, as
it were, in the person of believing Abraham.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the
view of St. Paul, the establishment of the Christian Church was
no dissolution of the Jewish Church.&nbsp; It is the same Society
still;&mdash;the same Body Corporate.&nbsp; Some of its rules and
regulations, indeed, have been altered: a disfranchisement of
many of its old members has taken place, and new ones have been
admitted: but the same Church,&mdash;the same Chartered
Company,&mdash;which existed <i>before the Law and under the
Law</i>, exists to this present hour under the Gospel
Dispensation.&nbsp; It is still Abraham&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He
is &ldquo;the father of all them that believe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;If ye be Christ&rsquo;s, then are ye Abraham&rsquo;s seed,
and heirs according to the promise.&rdquo; <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; When, therefore, any of the Jews
&ldquo;abide not in unbelief,&rdquo; <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and are received into the Church of
Christ, it is but &ldquo;the grafting of the natural branches
into <i>their own olive-tree</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are restored
to the privileges which their fathers enjoyed, and are made
members of the Church of God.&nbsp; But are their children to be
left behind?&nbsp; Are they to be left out of the Covenant?&nbsp;
And is this, might a converted Israelite justly ask,&mdash;Is
this to be restored to our fathers&rsquo; privileges?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Circumcision was not of the law, but of the
fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>That</i> is taken away; and what have we
in its place, if baptism, which is now the token of the covenant,
be withheld from our children?&nbsp; If circumcision was our
children&rsquo;s birthright before, how can they be deprived of
it, and have nothing given them in the stead thereof, and yet the
privileges possessed by our fathers not be lessened?&nbsp; This
is <i>not</i> to be &ldquo;grafted into <i>our own
olive-tree</i>&rdquo;!</p>
<p>In the first Chapter of his first Epistle to the Corinthians,
St. Paul speaks of baptism; but as it is principally with a
reference to himself, it is scarcely necessary to notice it in
our present consideration,&mdash;except for the statement he is
led to make of the great object of his mission; which was
&ldquo;<i>not</i> to baptize, but to preach the gospel:&rdquo;
the latter being the far more important and difficult work;
necessary as it was that converts to Christ should be
baptized.&nbsp; Divisions had arisen among the Corinthians:
&ldquo;one saying, I am of Paul,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, I prefer
Paul before all other Ministers, and others of them preferring
others.&nbsp; This state of things caused the <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Apostle great
distress, and he anxiously endeavours to correct it.&nbsp; He
indignantly asks them, whether he (or any other Minister) had
been &ldquo;crucified for them,&rdquo; or whether they had been
&ldquo;baptized <i>in his name</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shows that
baptism implies an entire dedication to him, in whose name it is
administered.&nbsp; The Apostle then tells them, that he was very
thankful it had been so ordered that he had baptized very few of
them himself;&mdash;adding, as the cause of this, &ldquo;for
Christ sent me not to baptize,&rdquo;&mdash;<i>that</i> might be
done by others,&mdash;&ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;He sent
me&mdash;&ldquo;to preach the gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Apostle
here cannot intend to put any slight upon Christ&rsquo;s
Ordinance of baptism, as is evident from what he has just said of
it, &ldquo;<i>Were ye baptized in the name of
Paul</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;but he intends to show, that it might be
administered by persons of inferior station and gifts in the
Church.&nbsp; And this is manifest from the very nature of the
service.</p>
<p>In the viith Chapter of this Epistle and the 14th verse there
is a text, in which (as with respect to the children brought to
Christ that He should touch them) baptism is not mentioned, and
yet it has so decided a bearing upon the subject, that we cannot
but carefully notice it.&nbsp; St. Paul is speaking of the case
of married persons, when one party believed, while the other
believed not.&nbsp; This he says is not a sufficient reason for
their separation: at least the separation should not be made by
the one that believed.&nbsp; And to satisfy the mind of the
believing &ldquo;brother or sister&rdquo; that the children <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>did not
suffer, he says,&mdash;&ldquo;For the unbelieving husband is
sanctified by (or in) the wife, and the unbelieving wife is
sanctified by (or in) the husband; <i>else were your children
unclean</i>, <i>but now are they holy</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
with the latter part of this verse that we have to do.&nbsp; The
Apostle here declares that children, which have one believing
parent, are on equal terms or in the same condition with
children, both of whose parents are believers; and thus they are
said to be not &ldquo;<i>unclean</i>&rdquo; but
&ldquo;<i>holy</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, can there be a doubt, that
the Apostle uses these epithets &ldquo;unclean&rdquo; and
&ldquo;holy,&rdquo; in the same sense in which they were used in
reference to the distinction between the Jews and the
Gentiles?&nbsp; The latter were called &ldquo;unclean,&rdquo;
because of their idolatries and other abominations; the former
were called &ldquo;holy,&rdquo; because of their connection and
Covenant with God.&nbsp; When the Apostle Peter was sent to
preach the gospel to Cornelius, he applied this word
&ldquo;unclean&rdquo; to all who were not Jews.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye
know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew, to
keep company or come unto <i>one of another nation</i>; but God
hath showed me that I should not call any man common or
<i>unclean</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the people of Israel are
repeatedly called &ldquo;holy to the Lord,&rdquo; because of the
Lord&rsquo;s choice of them and Covenant with them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou art <i>a holy people</i> unto the Lord thy
God,&rdquo; was the language in which Moses addressed them.
(Deut, vii. 6).&nbsp; And in this description their children were
included: for God&rsquo;s Covenant with Israel embraced <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>them also;
and thus every man-child, when eight days old, was to receive
circumcision, which was the token of the Covenant.&nbsp; From
these things we may learn the meaning of the Apostle in the
passage under consideration.&nbsp; The <i>uncleanness</i> of the
Gentiles was a barrier against their participating in the
Ordinances of the Jewish Church.&nbsp; The <i>holiness</i> of
Israel was their title to those Ordinances; and this too in the
case of their children.&nbsp; Surely, then, when the Apostle says
to believing Christian parents, &ldquo;Your children are
<i>holy</i>,&rdquo; he must mean that they are entitled to the
Ordinances of the Church of Christ!&nbsp; It seems impossible, if
St. Paul&rsquo;s language has any meaning, to avoid <i>this</i>
conclusion,&mdash;that <i>the children of the faithful</i>, <i>as
soon as they are born</i>, <i>have a Covenant-holiness</i>,
<i>and so a right and title to baptism</i>, <i>which is now the
token of the Covenant</i>.&nbsp; Their holiness, that is, their
being in covenant with God, does not date from their
<i>baptism</i>, but from their <i>birth</i>. <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a>&nbsp; To every believing parent God may
be supposed to say, as He said to Abraham, &ldquo;I will
establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
thee, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Much profit ariseth from this connection, if
it be made a right use of.&nbsp; Baptism, like circumcision,
verily profiteth, if the baptized child keep the law&mdash;the
requisition which God makes <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>of faith and obedience; but if he be
a breaker of the law, his baptism is made no baptism at all; as
circumcision was in such a case made uncircumcision.&nbsp; (See
Rom. ii. 25.)&nbsp; And let it be farther observed from this
text, that it is of <i>real believers</i> and their children that
the Apostle speaks when he says,&mdash;&ldquo;Now are your
children <i>holy</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence it appears, that the
faith of the parents is the foundation of any children&rsquo;s
claim to baptism.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Unclean</i>&rdquo; is the
description which is given of all others.</p>
<p>The only other passage in this Epistle in which baptism is
referred to, as a Christian Sacrament, is the 13th verse of the
xiith Chapter:&mdash;&ldquo;For by one Spirit are we all baptized
into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond
or free; and have been all made to drink into one
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; St. Paul may here allude to baptism in the
former part of the verse, and to the cup in the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper in the latter part of it.&nbsp; But whatever he may
<i>allude to</i>, what he <i>asserts</i> is this;&mdash;that it
was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which made them real members
of Christ&rsquo;s mystical body.&nbsp; The baptism of water was
the sign of this; but the sign would have profited them little,
if they had not received also the thing signified.&nbsp; The same
may be said of the cup in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; It is
for the nourishment of those who are real members of the Church
of Christ by the baptism of the Spirit: in fact, it cannot
possibly nourish any other.&nbsp; The essential unity of all
baptized believers, and yet the diversity of Offices and gifts
belonging to the several constituent <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>parts or members of Christ&rsquo;s
Church, seems to be what the Apostle is here inculcating upon the
Corinthians; and this with the special design to show them the
inconsistency and the evil of their emulations and
divisions.&nbsp; He aimed at curing them of their unseemly
strife, by reminding them that one and the same Holy Spirit had
made them all &ldquo;members of one body,&rdquo; but had set
those members in their several and suitable places; so that each
should be content with the place assigned him; and without
aspiring to something which had not been given him, or envying
those who might be in a higher or a supposed more honourable
state, should use what he had for the common good,&mdash;for the
strengthening and well-being of the whole: &ldquo;<i>that there
should be</i>,&rdquo; as he says in the 25th verse, &ldquo;<i>no
schism in the body</i>, <i>but that the members should have the
same care one for another</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Epistle to the Galatians furnishes us with the next
passage in our important inquiry.&nbsp; It is at the close of the
iiird Chapter, the 26th and two following
verses:&mdash;&ldquo;For ye are all the children of God by faith
in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; For as many of you as have been baptized
into Christ have put on Christ.&nbsp; There is neither Jew nor
Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor
female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here a
new idea is introduced;&mdash;a fresh practical use is made by
the Apostle of the Ordinance of baptism.&nbsp; And a very
striking and beautiful idea it is.&nbsp; The order hitherto
invariably found to prevail in what <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the Scripture says on the subject of
baptism is observable also here.&nbsp; The Apostle first reminds
the Galatians that <i>they were made the children of God by faith
in Christ Jesus</i>, and then he refers to their baptism and what
they had done by it.&nbsp; As we have considered the expressions,
&ldquo;baptized into Christ,&rdquo; as they occur in the Epistle
to the Romans, they need not be noticed here.&nbsp; But the
words, &ldquo;have put on Christ,&rdquo; represent to
us&mdash;what in connection with our subject we have not had
before&mdash;the clothing or garments which baptized believers
have put on, and in which they appear (when things are as they
ought to be with them) both before God and before men.&nbsp; This
phrase is said to have been taken from the method of dipping or
plunging adults in baptism; who, when they came forth from the
water, were clothed with their own garments as though they had
been new, or with other garments really new.&nbsp; There are two
senses in which true believers may be said to &ldquo;put on
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; First, they put Him on as their
righteousness for acceptance with God or for their justification;
and, secondly, they put Him on&mdash;(and this seems especially
intended here)&mdash;for sanctification; that is, His Spirit is
imparted to them, by which they are so changed as to become new
creatures.&nbsp; The graces of Christ&rsquo;s Spirit are
sometimes thus described under the figure of clothing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Put on, as the elect of God, holy and beloved,&rdquo;
writes St. Paul to the Colossians, &ldquo;bowels of mercies,
kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long-suffering.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And above all these <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>things, put
on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.&rdquo; (iii. 12,
14.)&nbsp; The Spirit of Christ ought to be as apparent in those
who have been baptized into Him as the garments which they
wear.&nbsp; Nay, His meekness, and lowliness, and gentleness, and
goodness, and heavenly-mindedness, should become <i>a part of
themselves</i>&mdash;<i>their very nature</i>.&nbsp; For as the
work of sanctification, expressed by the being clothed upon with
&lsquo;Christ, is both <i>internal</i> and <i>outward</i>, it may
be compared to <i>the natural beauty</i> with which Christ
Himself said that God clothes the plants and the flowers: and
when Christians manifest the genuine influence of the Spirit of
Christ, it may then indeed be said of them, as He said of the
lilies, &ldquo;that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words in the 28th verse,
&ldquo;There is neither male nor female,&rdquo;&mdash;connected
with what follows, &ldquo;If ye be Christ&rsquo;s, then are ye
Abraham&rsquo;s seed,&rdquo;&mdash;clearly show that circumcision
was superseded, and that baptism now supplied its place.</p>
<p>Upon St. Paul&rsquo;s declaration in the ivth Chapter of his
Epistle to the Ephesians, &ldquo;One baptism,&rdquo; it is
perhaps only necessary to remark, that it again follows
faith;&mdash;&ldquo;One faith,&rdquo;&mdash;the same doctrine of
salvation once for all delivered to the saints and to be received
by faith,&mdash;and then, &ldquo;One baptism&rdquo; with water,
by which that faith is professed, and in which believers are by
One Spirit baptized into One body, and dedicated to the service
of the One living and true God.&nbsp; It is One and the same
Ordinance <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>for all,&mdash;for Jews and Gentiles; and once
administered, not to be repeated.&nbsp; The practical purpose for
which this, with the other Unities, was mentioned by the Apostle,
was to enforce the same lesson as that given to the
Corinthians,&mdash;that Christians should &ldquo;endeavour to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&rdquo; (v.
3.)</p>
<p>In the vth Chapter of this Epistle there appears another
allusion to baptism, when the Apostle says, that &ldquo;Christ
loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify
and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.&rdquo; (v.
26.)&nbsp; It is not necessary to the sense and force of this
verse to suppose that baptism is referred to in it; for the word
of God has a cleansing and sanctifying power, when applied by His
Spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is
truth;&rdquo; was Christ&rsquo;s prayer for His disciples to His
heavenly Father.&nbsp; And He also said unto them, &ldquo;Now ye
are clean <i>through the word</i> which I have spoken unto
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as it is a continuous and progressive work,
which the Apostle is here speaking of, and not any one particular
act,&mdash;for the use of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>word</i>&rdquo;
in the work of sanctification is continually repeated,&mdash;it
seems much more natural to understand the expressions,
&ldquo;with the washing of water by&rdquo; or in &ldquo;the
word,&rdquo; as referring to the figure of water, and its
purifying properties in general, rather than to a single instance
of its application.&nbsp; But there can be no objection to refer
these expressions to baptism, as being an Ordinance which is
supposed to be kept <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>always in remembrance, and to have a constant bearing
upon the believer&rsquo;s life and conduct.&nbsp; Let us take it
here, and every where else, in connection with the context, and
we shall find that it represents&mdash;not an imaginary, but a
real&mdash;not a temporary, but an abiding&mdash;influence upon
the soul;&mdash;issuing in its final salvation.&nbsp; Who is this
that is said to be washed with water by the word?&nbsp; The mixed
multitude of professors of Christ&rsquo;s religion?&nbsp;
No:&mdash;but &ldquo;<i>the Church</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;the blessed
Company of all faithful people&mdash;&ldquo;the Bride&mdash;the
Lambs wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what is the effect ascribed to the
washing?&nbsp; Her cleansing and sanctification.&nbsp; But as the
Church is composed of individuals, every individual member
thereof is &ldquo;sanctified, and cleansed with the washing of
water by the word,&rdquo; and so is made meet to be presented by
Christ to Himself at the last in perfect beauty.&nbsp; Let these
things attend and crown the use of the Ordinances, and men may
magnify them&mdash;as Paul did his Office&mdash;as much as they
please.</p>
<p>The next place in Scripture in which baptism is spoken of, is
in the iind Chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Colossians.&nbsp; At the 11th verse he begins the subject.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In whom also,&rdquo; that is, in Christ, &ldquo;ye are
circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting
off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ: buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen
with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath
raised Him from the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Apostle&rsquo;s object
here is to show, that the Christian&rsquo;s completeness <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>in Christ
(asserted in the former verse) is not affected by the want of
circumcision; for that true believers have that which was
represented by circumcision, only under another form and
name.&nbsp; By &ldquo;the circumcision made without hands,&rdquo;
the circumcision of the heart is evidently intended.&nbsp; By
&ldquo;the circumcision of Christ&rdquo; is probably <i>not</i>
meant the circumcision which Christ Himself was subjected to, but
the circumcision with which Christ circumcises.&nbsp; This would
therefore refer to the Christian Sacrament of baptism, wherever
rightly received.&nbsp; This is the corresponding type with, as
well as antitype of, circumcision; because, like circumcision, it
represents and seals the blessings of the Covenant to
believers.&nbsp; The latter part of this passage is so like the
one already considered in the vith chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans, that it need not be dwelt upon.&nbsp; The death, burial
and resurrection of Christ are not only signs and patterns of
what <i>should take place</i> with respect to Christians, but
they are effectual causes thereof in the case of all who are
spiritually joined to Him; and the whole is, as it were,
<i>consolidated in baptism</i>.&nbsp; The faith which goes
before, and which is exercised in the Ordinance, and the fruits
which follow after, are all summed up in and referred to this
Sacrament: and well and happy it is, whenever this is truly the
case.</p>
<p>Two texts more remain to be considered in relation to our
subject.&nbsp; The first is found in that passage in the iiird
Chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to Titus, from the 4th to the
7th verse.&nbsp; &ldquo;But after that <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the kindness and love of God our
Saviour toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which
we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, by the
washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He
shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that
being justified by His grace, we should be made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The word here
translated &ldquo;washing&rdquo; signifies also <i>a laver</i>,
or vessel for washing: but the translation is undoubtedly
correct, and <i>ablution</i> or <i>the act of washing</i>, is
intended.&nbsp; This word only occurs here and in Ephes. v. 26.,
which we have already considered; where it must be translated (as
it is) &ldquo;<i>washing</i>:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the washing of
water by the word.&rdquo;&nbsp; That regeneration washes or
cleanses the soul from the filthiness of sin, is all that can be
proved by this passage.&nbsp; The washing is by the regeneration,
and not the regeneration by the washing.&nbsp; There <i>may
be</i> an allusion to the Christian Sacrament of baptism; but it
is not at all necessary to the understanding of the
Apostle&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; <i>St. Paul is here describing what
God does when He saves any</i>.&nbsp; He sheds on them abundantly
the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ the Saviour, and this Holy
Ghost regenerates, and washes and renews; and, in connection with
this, God justifies the subjects of this change by His grace, and
so makes them heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&nbsp;
The regeneration and the renewal are not two distinct things; but
the latter is the declaration of the former;&mdash;the
transforming of the soul into <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the divine image, consequent upon and
in necessary connection with its regeneration.&nbsp; But does
this text prove, that all who are washed by the water of baptism
partake of regeneration?&nbsp; Then it also proves, that all
baptized persons are saved, and that they are renewed by the Holy
Ghost, and that the Holy Ghost is shed on them abundantly, and
that they are justified by God&rsquo;s grace, and that they are
heirs of eternal life!&nbsp; It is impossible, without doing
violence to God&rsquo;s word, to rend the blessings, here spoken
of, asunder.&nbsp; They are links in one and the same golden
chain, both the ends of which are in Heaven;&mdash;beginning with
&ldquo;the love of God&rdquo; and terminating with &ldquo;eternal
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And are these things true in the case of
<i>all who are baptized</i>?&nbsp; If this were taught in the
Scripture, what then might the infidel say of it?&nbsp; He might
then say, that Scripture and matter of fact directly contradict
each other.&nbsp; Or it would follow, that regeneration and the
renewing of the Holy Ghost and justification and salvation, are
terms which mean nothing, because the things they profess to
represent have no practical influence upon the lives of
men!&nbsp; We must, then, take the passage altogether, or not
touch it at all.&nbsp; We must not choose a word or two out of
it,&mdash;caught by the sound,&mdash;and affix a meaning to them,
which is inconsistent with the context and other plain portions
of revealed truth.&nbsp; If baptism be the washing here spoken
of, it is accompanied with regeneration and the renewing of the
Holy Ghost, shed on the baptized abundantly; and this <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>cannot be
without the exhibition of the fruits of the Spirit in the life
and conduct.&nbsp; And if this be Christian baptism, where these
things are not, Christian baptism is not.&nbsp; And this is
incontestably established by the testimony of St. Peter, in the
text about to be noticed.&nbsp; Let it only be farther observed,
in connection with this passage in St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to
Titus, that a no mean authority in the interpretation of
Scripture (Mr. Joseph Mede) thinks, that the Apostle here alludes
to the cleansing of the new-born infant from the pollutions which
attend its birth: and he refers to the description given in the
beginning of the xvith Chapter of the Book of the prophet Ezekiel
in confirmation of this:&mdash;&ldquo;Neither wast thou washed in
water.&rdquo; (v. 4.)&nbsp; Here, then, <i>life</i> is first
found, and then there is <i>the washing</i> for purification.</p>
<p>The text, already referred to, in St. Peter, is the 21st verse
of the iiird Chapter of his First Epistle.&nbsp; This perfects
the proof of the view hitherto taken of the Christian Sacrament
of baptism; and is <i>a key</i> which would unlock any difficulty
which other portions of Scripture might present;&mdash;if indeed
such assistance were needed.&nbsp; St. Peter is speaking of the
days of Noah, and he says, that &ldquo;the long-suffering of God
then waited, while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is,
eight souls were saved by water;&rdquo; and then he adds,
&ldquo;The like figure whereunto,&rdquo;&mdash;the corresponding
type with it, and the antitype of it&mdash;(as was observed
before respecting circumcision) &ldquo;even baptism, doth now
save <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>us,&rdquo;&mdash;but before he completes the sentence,
he breaks off to tell us what this baptism, of which he speaks,
is, &ldquo;<i>not</i> the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience towards God,&rdquo; and then
he finishes what he had begun to say,&mdash;&ldquo;by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now if the two things
here spoken of in relation to baptism were always found together,
the words of St. Peter would be without meaning; for none,
possessing them both, could be so blind as to imagine that it is
the outward washing which saves them, and not &ldquo;the answer
of a good conscience;&rdquo; though <i>it is possible</i> (as
experience shows) that men might be satisfied with the outward
sign, and look no farther, as the Jews had done in the case of
circumcision.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit, therefore, by the pen of St.
Peter warns against this error, and assures us, that the baptism
which is unto salvation consists of, not only, nor chiefly, the
application of water to the body, but &ldquo;the answer of a good
conscience toward God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is thought by some, that a
<i>reference</i> is here made to the custom of putting questions
to those who were about to be baptized as to their faith and
repentance: and something of this kind had passed between Philip
and the Eunuch, when Philip told him that &ldquo;if he believed
with all his heart he might be baptized, and the Eunuch answered,
I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
every such case there doubtless is <i>the
baptism</i>&mdash;because there has been <i>the
birth</i>&mdash;of the Spirit.&nbsp; But though St. Peter&rsquo;s
words <i>may be</i> applicable <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>to such a custom, if it prevailed in
his time, yet, as Archbishop Leighton says in his Commentary on
this text, &lsquo;This questioning and answering farther
expresses the inward questioning and answering which is
transacted betwixt the soul and itself, and the soul of
God.&nbsp; The word,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is <i>judicial</i>,
and means the interrogation used in law for the trial and
executing of processes: and this is the great business of
conscience, to hold courts in the soul; and it is of continual
necessity that it be so.&nbsp; This &ldquo;answer of a good
conscience unto God&rdquo; (as likewise its questioning to enable
itself for that answer) is touching great points that are of
chief concern to the soul, its justification and sanctification;
for baptism is the seal of <i>both</i>, and purges the conscience
in both respects.&nbsp; Now, the conscience of a real believer
inquiring within, upon right discovery, will make this answer
unto God;&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I have found that there is no
standing before Thee, for the soul in itself is overwhelmed with
a world of guiltiness; but I find a blood sprinkled upon it, that
hath, I am sure, virtue enough to purge it all away, and to
present it pure unto Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this the Lord does
agree to, and authorizes the conscience, on this account, to
return back an answer of peace and safety to the soul.&nbsp; So
for the other: &ldquo;Lord, I find a living work of holiness on
this soul.&nbsp; Though there is yet corruption there, it is as a
continual grief and vexation: and if I cannot say much of high
degrees of grace, yet I may say, there is the beginning of
them;&mdash;at least this <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>I most confidently affirm, that there
are real and earnest desires in the soul after these
things.&nbsp; It would know and conform to Thy will, and it would
gladly walk <i>in all well-pleasing</i> unto Thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now He that sees the truth of these things, owns it as His own
work, and engages to advance it and bring it to
perfection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is the intercourse which the purified conscience hath
with God; and wherever this is, there is the
&ldquo;baptism&rdquo; which is unto salvation.</p>
<p>In the examination which has thus been made into the
Scripture-testimony concerning the Christian Sacrament of
Baptism, no text has been&mdash;at least
intentionally&mdash;overlooked, from which any additional
information could be obtained on the subject.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From the passages which have been considered, the following
conclusions may be taken as the Summary of the whole:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That baptism with water has been appointed by Christ
as the door of entrance into His Visible Church, and is the token
of the Covenant of grace under the Christian Dispensation, in the
place of circumcision, which was the token of this Covenant upon
its formal establishment with Abraham.&nbsp; To be baptized with
water, therefore, is necessary to constitute any one a member of
the Visible Church of Christ or Kingdom of God upon earth.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That since <i>faith</i> hath from the beginning been
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>appointed
by God, as the instrument or means by which men are admitted into
Covenant with Him, it was the command of the Lord Jesus Christ
that baptism, which is now the token of the Covenant, should be
administered only to <i>believers</i>.&nbsp; It was the same with
respect to circumcision.&nbsp; Abraham believed God: and, as a
believer, he was circumcised.&nbsp; And true believers only are
acknowledged by Christ as rightful members of His Church.&nbsp;
Yet as Abraham&rsquo;s children were admitted to circumcision
together with himself, it is hence inferred, that the children of
believers in Christ should be baptized, as well as their parents:
no prohibition of their admission to the Ordinance having been
given.&nbsp; This conclusion is confirmed by Christ&rsquo;s kind
reception of the children that were brought to Him&mdash;by the
application of Old Testament promises after Christ&rsquo;s
resurrection&mdash;by the declared continuance of the root and
fatness of the Olive-tree planted at first in Abraham&mdash;and
by the description given of the children of even one believing
parent, namely, that they are holy; that is, such as ought to be
presented to the Lord.&nbsp; Still, no direction to administer
baptism to children has been found, nor is any instance of it
recorded.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That although Christ, the Head of the Church, sows
only good seed in His field, His enemy has succeeded in sowing
tares among the wheat; and thus it comes to pass, that evil men
are in the Visible Church mingled with the good.&nbsp; Hence we
learn, that neither baptism nor any outward Ordinances <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>are
<i>necessarily</i> attended with spiritual blessings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All were not Israel, who were of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was not a Jew, who was one outwardly; neither was that
circumcision, which was outward in the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we
have seen that the &ldquo;baptism&rdquo; which
&ldquo;saves,&rdquo; is &ldquo;not the putting away of the filth
of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Simon Magus, though baptized, was not sound in
heart from the beginning.&nbsp; And if during the life-time of
the Apostles, and when persons were baptized upon their own
profession, men thus found admission into the Church, who
&ldquo;had the form of godliness, but denied its
power,&rdquo;&mdash;no wonder that in later times, and since
baptism has been administered almost exclusively to infants, the
case should have been the same.&nbsp; For we have met with no
promise that God will give His grace to any particular persons,
except in connection with the state of mind and the character
which He prescribes.&nbsp; In no place of Scripture has God bound
the first communication of His grace to any Ordinance, time, or
circumstance whatsoever:&mdash;and for this simple, but
sufficient reason, that if He had done so, it would have been an
abdication of His authority; His sovereignty would have ceased;
and man would have become&mdash;what in truth he wishes to
be&mdash;the virtual ruler in God&rsquo;s Kingdom.&nbsp; God no
where promised to circumcise the hearts of all the children of
the Israelites, although He commanded them to be circumcised in
the flesh.&nbsp; And with respect to the baptism of children, <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>how can
<i>any thing absolute and unconditional</i> be predicated
concerning it, since no command or direction was given for
it?&nbsp; The administration of baptism to infants is certainly
most agreeable with the spirit of Christ and of His Dispensation,
and it is but a continuance of what was begun in the family of
Abraham.&nbsp; But resting, as it does, upon inference and
analogy, it is not possible to assign any specific spiritual
influence with absolute certainty to it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That with respect to the advantages and uses of
baptism,&mdash;besides its being appointed by Christ as the door
of admission into His Visible Church, and the practical purposes
to which it is applied in the course of the Christian&rsquo;s
conduct and experience,&mdash;very little particular instruction
is given in Scripture.&nbsp; To the corresponding rite of
circumcision, therefore, we chiefly look for direction here.</p>
<p>It may be said, then, of baptism, as of circumcision,</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That it is <i>a sign</i> of spiritual
blessings.&nbsp; Of Abraham we are told, that he &ldquo;received
<i>the sign</i> of circumcision.&rdquo; (Rom. iv. 11.)&nbsp; This
Ordinance <i>represented</i> &ldquo;the putting off of the body
of the sins of the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baptism with water also
<i>signifies</i> the washing of the soul from sin;&mdash;both
from the guilt of it by forgiveness and from the pollution of
it.&nbsp; When Saul of Tarsus was bidden to &ldquo;be baptized,
and wash away his sins,&rdquo; this twofold purification was
visibly represented.&nbsp; And so it is in all cases.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The putting away of the filth of the flesh&rdquo; by the
application of &ldquo;pure water&rdquo; to the body, does in a <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>very simple
and intelligible, yet striking and significant manner, represent
the purging of the conscience by the sprinkling of the blood of
Christ, and the cleansing of the heart from its filthiness and
idols by God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit.&nbsp; It symbolizes both pardon
and purity:&mdash;especially the latter;&mdash;the soul&rsquo;s
death unto sin and its new birth unto righteousness.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Like circumcision, baptism is also <i>a
seal</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Abraham&rdquo; (as we also read in Rom.
iv. 11,) &ldquo;received circumcision, <i>a seal</i> of the
righteousness of the faith, which he had yet being
uncircumcised.&rdquo;&nbsp; A seal ratifies a Deed, and is a
token and pledge that the engagements of it will be fulfilled by
all the contracting parties.&nbsp; When Abraham submitted to
circumcision, he ratified or confirmed his former faith in God
and obedience to Him; and God, by the same pledge, assured
Abraham of his justification&mdash;of his adoption into His
family&mdash;and that he should finally inherit a better country,
that is, Heaven.</p>
<p>Baptism, in like manner, is <i>a seal</i> on the part of those
who receive it rightly, that they believe in God through Christ,
and regard themselves as bound to forsake all sin, and to serve
Him unto their lives&rsquo; end: and God thereby visibly assures
them of the remission of their sins and of their adoption as His
children, and that, as He gives them grace, so He will give them
glory.&nbsp; And if this visible seal of the Covenant had not
been serviceable, the wise and gracious God would never, either
in the case of circumcision or baptism, have caused it to be
affixed unto it.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>(3.)&nbsp; Circumcision had <i>this</i>
&ldquo;profit&rdquo; also connected with it,&mdash;that the
different means of grace, which God from time to time appointed,
followed in its train.&nbsp; St. Paul, having distinctly declared
at the end of the iind Chapter of his Epistle to the Romans, that
the circumcision of the flesh and of the heart did not
necessarily accompany each other, supposes some, who were
&ldquo;Jews outwardly,&rdquo; to exclaim,&mdash;If this be
so,&mdash;if the inward grace does not always attend the outward
sign,&mdash;and that the want of the inward grace puts us
circumcised Jews on the same level spiritually with uncircumcised
Gentiles, then, &ldquo;What advantage hath the Jew?&nbsp; Or what
profit is thereof circumcision?&rdquo; (iii. 1.)&nbsp; <i>Is the
same question asked respecting baptism</i>, <i>when a like
separation is made between the water and the Holy
Spirit</i>?&nbsp; The Apostle&rsquo;s answer shall suffice for
both:&mdash;&ldquo;Much every way; chiefly, because that unto
them were committed the oracles of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is here
evident, that God regards the possession of a Revelation from
Heaven as highly advantageous, considered in itself; so that for
the neglect or misuse of it men are deeply responsible.&nbsp; In
the beginning of the ixth Chapter, St. Paul again takes up the
subject, and enumerates several other &ldquo;advantages&rdquo; as
belonging to the Jews;&mdash;&ldquo;the adoption, and the glory,
and the Covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of
God, and the promises, and the fathers, and that Christ, as
concerning His human nature, was born a Jew;&rdquo;&mdash;and
though the circumcision of the heart together with that of the <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>flesh is not
found among these, yet the Apostle maintains, that the possession
of them did set the Israelites, in point of religious privileges,
far above all the other nations of the earth.&nbsp; And it is the
same with those who are admitted into Christ&rsquo;s Church by
baptism.&nbsp; Having free access to the word of God and
instruction in its sacred truths&mdash;the enjoyment of His
Sabbaths and Service&mdash;having His promises and threatenings,
and the experience of their fulfilment in time past, together
with the examples of faith and godliness and the blessed effects
of them in such as have gone before&mdash;all these are so many
means of improvement, as will leave speechless at the last those
who had them and did not profit by them.&nbsp; While all who use
them aright, and sincerely seek to derive benefit from them, find
to their exceeding great comfort, that God hath &ldquo;not said
to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was no
small advantage to Abraham&rsquo;s family to be &ldquo;commanded
by him to keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
judgment:&rdquo; (Gen. xviii. 19,) and that children should be
&ldquo;brought up&rdquo; by Christian parents &ldquo;in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord,&rdquo; and be taught what was
done for them at their baptism, united too with earnest prayers
on their behalf,&mdash;is a privilege, for which many will to all
eternity have cause to bless Him, who gave them so &ldquo;goodly
a heritage.&rdquo; (Ps. xvi. 6.)</p>
<p>Lastly.&nbsp; We would refer again, concerning the advantages
and uses of baptism, to that <i>practical </i><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span><i>application of it</i> which we have seen may be made
throughout the whole course of the Christian&rsquo;s life upon
earth.&nbsp; He is to remember, that he was &ldquo;baptized into
the death of Christ and buried with Him,&rdquo; that so he may
die unto sin, and have, as much as possible, done with it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Risen with Christ in baptism,&rdquo; his &ldquo;affections
should be set on things above,&rdquo; and he should &ldquo;walk
in newness of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Baptized into one
body,&rdquo; strife and divisions should not be seen among
Christians, and &ldquo;the unity of the spirit should be kept in
the bond of peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Baptized into Christ, and
having put on Christ,&rdquo; they should appear in the beautiful
clothing of His mind and Spirit.&nbsp; They should seek and pray
daily to be more and more &ldquo;sanctified and cleansed with the
washing of water by the word,&rdquo; that they may be
&ldquo;prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thus baptism, if used as the Scripture uses it, would be of great
practical influence.&nbsp; And when this is the case, it may be
productive of much comfort; for, like the bow in the cloud, it is
a token of God&rsquo;s Covenant to save and not destroy.&nbsp;
The water of baptism, in the case of every true believer,
&ldquo;is as the waters of Noah unto the Lord: for as He hath
sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the
earth,&rdquo; so in this Sacrament He hath, as it were, added His
oath to His word of promise, that &ldquo;he that believeth and is
baptized <i>shall he saved</i>.&rdquo; (Is. liv. 9.&nbsp; Mark
xvi 16.)</p>

87</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3><i>Note</i> (A.) <i>page</i> <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page27">27</a></span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> God said to Abraham, (Gen.
xvii. 7.) &ldquo;I will establish my Covenant between me and thee
and thy seed after thee, in their generations for an everlasting
Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after
thee,&rdquo; His meaning was, that as He was the God of
<i>believing Abraham</i>, so He would be the God of all
Abraham&rsquo;s <i>believing children and descendants</i>.&nbsp;
And when He farther promised to &ldquo;give unto Abraham and to
his seed after him, the land in which he was a stranger, even all
the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession,&rdquo; the
same limitation as to &ldquo;his seed&rdquo; was also
intended.&nbsp; That these, and these only, are the
&ldquo;seed&rdquo; referred to, is as clear as the declarations
of Holy Scripture can make it.&nbsp; In the Epistles to the
Romans and Galatians this matter is placed beyond a doubt.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;seed&rdquo; must partake of <i>the character of the
father</i>, and then the promises were theirs, as well as
his.&nbsp; In the ivth Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans and
the 12th verse, the Apostle, speaking of Abraham, says, that he
was to be &ldquo;the father of circumcision to them <i>who are
not of the circumcision only</i>, (that is, who are not only
circumcised in the flesh) <i>but also walk in the steps of that
faith of Abraham</i>, <i>which he had yet being
uncircumcised</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Could any thing be plainer than
this?&nbsp; St. Paul is here speaking of the circumcised <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Jews, (he had
spoken of the uncircumcised Gentiles in the former verse, the
11th,) and he says distinctly, that Abraham was a father to those
circumcised ones who should &ldquo;walk in the steps of his
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that the following is evidently the
Apostle&rsquo;s meaning in the 11th and 12th verses: &lsquo;Both
Jew and Gentile may see, in God&rsquo;s dealings with Abraham, an
exhibition of the plan in which each is to seek the imputation of
righteousness.&nbsp; Let the uncircumcised believe in God, as
Abraham, when yet uncircumcised, believed in God; and his faith
shall be counted to him for righteousness, as Abraham&rsquo;s
was.&nbsp; Let the Jews, too, learn from the case before them,
that though, like circumcised Abraham, they bear in their bodies
the seal of the Covenant, yet <i>the sign of circumcision alone
will not ensure the blessing signified</i>, <i>unless at the same
time they are found resembling Abraham in the exercise of that
faith</i>, <i>in consequence of which the seal was fixed upon
him</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp; These,
then,&mdash;<i>believers</i>,&mdash;are the &ldquo;seed&rdquo; of
Abraham, with whom the Covenant was made, and to whom the
promises were given.&nbsp; And this is confirmed by what
follows.&nbsp; In the next verse the Apostle goes on to say;
&ldquo;For the promise that he should be the heir of the
world,&rdquo;&mdash;(which is the inspired exposition of the
other part or promise of God&rsquo;s Covenant with Abraham;
&ldquo;And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
land wherein thou art a stranger, for an everlasting
possession;&rdquo;)&mdash;&ldquo;For the promise that he should
be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or <i>to his
seed</i> through the law, but <i>through the righteousness of
faith</i>:&rdquo; and again, in the 16th verse; &ldquo;Therefore
it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end <i>the
promise might be sure to all the seed</i>; not to that only which
is of the law, (believing circumcised Jews) but to that also
which is of the faith of Abraham, (believing uncircumcised
Gentiles) who is <i>the father of us all</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, of all believers, whether circumcised or
not,&mdash;&ldquo;before Him whom he believed, even God, who
quickeneth the dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The promise,&rdquo;
then, &ldquo;that he should be the heir of the world&rdquo;
(evidently meaning the <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>better world, that is, the heavenly,)
&ldquo;was to Abraham and <i>to his seed through the
righteousness of faith</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not to his
<i>unbelieving descendants</i>, but to those only who were
partakers of his faith;&mdash;to all of whom, the promise was and
still is &ldquo;<i>sure</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We pass over the ixth
Chapter of this Epistle, though it is full of evidence to the
same effect; and proceed to the Epistle to the Galatians; where
we shall find the description of Abraham&rsquo;s
&ldquo;seed&rdquo; given in language, if possible, still plainer
and stronger.&nbsp; In the iiird Chapter and the 6th verse the
Apostle begins the subject: &ldquo;Even as Abraham believed God,
and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&nbsp; Know ye,
therefore, that <i>they which are of faith</i>, the same <i>are
the children</i> of Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So then they
which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then in the 14th verse, the Apostle tells us more of this
blessing of Abraham: &ldquo;That the blessing of Abraham might
come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive
the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
promise of the Spirit&rdquo; is here said to be &ldquo;received
through faith;&rdquo;&mdash;that is, by them that believe.&nbsp;
But in the 16th verse, the account given of the
&ldquo;seed&rdquo; of Abraham is as distinct and decisive as
words can make it.&nbsp; Referring to the Covenant made by God
with Abraham, (contained in Gen. xvii.) St. Paul says, &ldquo;Now
to Abraham <i>and his seed</i> were the promises made.&nbsp; He
saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to <i>thy
seed which is Christ</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; By &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;
here (it is scarcely necessary to remark) is not meant Christ
<i>personal</i>, but Christ <i>mystical</i>;&mdash;His mystical
Body, consisting of Christ himself, the Head, and true believers,
both Jews and Gentiles, &ldquo;all one in Him.&rdquo; (v.
28.)&nbsp; The same expression is used in 1 Cor. xii. 12:
&ldquo;For as the body (the natural body) is one, and hath many
members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are
one body; <i>so also is Christ</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Believers in
Christ, then, who compose His mystical Body, are <i>the seed of
Abraham</i>, to whom with himself,&mdash;&ldquo;the father of all
them that believe,&rdquo;&mdash;the promises of the Covenant were
made.&nbsp; And, intent upon inforcing this truth, and leaving no
possibility of mistaking <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>his meaning, the Apostle concludes
the subject with these words; (v. 29.) &ldquo;And if ye be
Christ&rsquo;s,&rdquo; (by believing in Him and by being baptized
by One Spirit into his One Body) &ldquo;<i>then</i> are ye
Abraham&rsquo;s seed, and heirs according to the
promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; A clearer and a fuller description of
<i>the persons</i>, to whom the promises of the Covenant were
made, could not possibly have been given!&nbsp; God did not
promise to be a God, and to give the inheritance of which Canaan
was a type, <i>to all</i> the natural descendants of Abraham,
though they were all to be circumcised; but <i>to those only who
should</i> &ldquo;<i>walk in the steps of his
faith</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this <i>limitation</i> of the meaning
of the &ldquo;<i>seed</i>&rdquo; of Abraham does no more violence
to the text, than the <i>extension</i> of the meaning of
&ldquo;Canaan&rdquo; to the heavenly world.&nbsp; But there is
(as we have seen) <i>inspired authority</i> for both
interpretations.&nbsp; <i>These</i>, then, were the
&ldquo;seed,&rdquo; to whom the promises were made.&nbsp; And it
is the same still.&nbsp; The children of professing believers are
baptized; but the outward form of baptism does not secure to them
the blessings thereby sealed to the believer, unless they also
have a true and lively faith.&nbsp; <i>Then</i> the promises are
theirs.&nbsp; The Scripture warrants us to go thus far, but no
farther.&nbsp; And when man attempts to put benefits into
Ordinances, which God has not revealed to him, he makes himself
wise &ldquo;above that which is written;&rdquo; and thus does in
effect what the Jews did,&mdash;and for which they were so justly
reproved by the Lord Jesus Himself;&mdash;he &ldquo;teaches for
doctrines the commandments of men.&rdquo; (Matt. xv. 9.)</p>
<h3><i>Note</i> (B.) <i>page</i> 50.</h3>
<p>It is expressly said in the 32nd verse, that Paul and Silas
&ldquo;spake the word of the Lord to <i>all that were in the
jailor&rsquo;s house</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was <i>before</i>
they were baptized.&nbsp; All that were in his house were capable
therefore of instruction; and thus their &ldquo;faith came by
hearing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to show more decidedly the existence of
faith in <i>the </i><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span><i>family</i>, not only is <i>the fact</i> itself
stated, but also <i>the fruit</i> which it produced: namely, its
adding to the jailor&rsquo;s joy.&nbsp; He rejoiced&mdash;of
course <i>the more</i>&mdash;because that <i>his house
believed</i>, as well as himself.</p>
<h3><i>Note</i> (C.) <i>page</i> 57.</h3>
<p>The baptism of a believer is like the coronation of a lawful
Sovereign.&nbsp; The latter at his coronation publicly enters
upon his Office.&nbsp; He is then anointed, and invested with the
robes and other ensigns of royalty.&nbsp; The crown is then
solemnly put upon his head&mdash;the sceptre into his
hand&mdash;and he swears in the presence of the nobles and chief
of the people to rule according to law: and any subsequent
dereliction of duty would be called <i>a breaking of his
coronation-oath</i>.&nbsp; But he was <i>in reality</i> king
before his coronation.&nbsp; Thus when a man repents, he forsakes
sin; (and what is the forsaking of it but the dying to it?) and
when he believes, he is born of God; (and what is this but his
spiritual resurrection?) and this repentance and this faith are
both required of every one <i>before</i>, <i>and in order to</i>,
<i>his baptism</i>.&nbsp; But at his baptism he is publicly
invested with his privileges as a Christian, and he then solemnly
swears to live according to Christ&rsquo;s laws for the
future.&nbsp; And thus every departure from duty may well be
called <i>a violation of his baptismal engagements</i>.&nbsp; But
<i>in reality</i> his death unto sin and his new birth unto
righteousness commenced when he repented and believed; that is,
at a period prior to (and under some circumstances the interval
of time might be very considerable) his baptism.&nbsp; His claim
to baptism is founded upon his having already renounced sin and
being possessed of a lively faith;&mdash;as a claim to be crowned
is founded upon this, that the person who makes it is the
rightful sovereign already.&nbsp; In both cases, there is <i>the
confirmation</i> of the relationship with all its rights and
duties, but not <i>the commencement</i> of it.&nbsp; <i>This</i>
had taken place <i>before</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
